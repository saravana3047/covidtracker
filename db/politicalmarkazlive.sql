We need a separate discussion for each of these topics.', '<h4 style="text-align: left;">Reappearance of the Ottoman Empire under the framework of Erdogan</h4>\r\n<h5 style="text-align: left;">By Syed Jawad Naqvi</h5>\r\n<p>Amongst the current affairs there are many ongoing topics. We need a separate discussion for each of these topics. Since there has been a long break also whereby these topics have not been discussed. If Allah gives opportunity we will take up these issues one by one. In today&rsquo;s discussion we will discuss about the current state of Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As it was broadcasted on media and everyone has seen that a name sake Military coup took place and then the incidents which took place after it has made everyone anxious outside Turkey and specifically in Pakistan as to what is the actual issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The actual issue is a link or a step from the dream which Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey, wants to materialize and for which he has adopted a political plan and this issue is part of the same. We can say that the dream of Ottoman era or Ottoman Sultanate is now seen in the Erdogan Sultanate. We can even give the title to these issue as &ldquo;Reappearance of the Ottoman Empire under the framework of Erdogan&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In order to understand the current affairs in Turkey first of all we should know that this incident has neither started from here and not will it end here. This issue has started long before and it will continue for long time. It is not just Turkey which is under the grip of these issues in fact outside Turkey also in Middle East and other parts of East and maybe in entire Islamic world it will demonstrate its effects. Hence it is necessary to understand what is there on scene and also its background.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" />What is seen is that one group of Turkish army has done a rebellion starting a coup and within few hours the Turkish people came out on street, they resisted this coup and protected the throne and power of Erdogan. And as a consequence those who were accused of this coup are being arrested and upcoming operations are becoming practical gradually. This rebellion which has taken place in Turkey was about to happen and still has a possibility now as well. In order to prevent the actual rebellion this rebellion has been articulated. We can say in other words that this rebellion was a velvet rebellion. Whatever has happened in Turkey is a velvet forces rebellion to stop the actual bloody rebellion of forces. The upcoming incidents will reveal whether this velvet rebellion has been successful in preventing the actual rebellion or whether it has prepared the ground further for the actual blood shedding rebellion.</p>\r\n<p>The current rulers of Turkey amongst whom top of the list, Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is also the host of the ruling party of Turkey has a conspiracy and plan in this mind. From the time he stepped in politics and the party to whom he belongs has a plan for Turkey which is gradually becoming practical and successful. At the current moment we can consider Erdogan as a successful conspiring politician but what will come in future cannot be said. We can say that whatever he has planned, conspired till now has been successful</p>\r\n<p>to the extent beyond his expectations. In order to understand this conspiracy, plan and what they want to achieve we have to go back a little in the past of Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Ottoman Empire</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="196" />The past of Turkey is very elegant and beautiful. We can say that no Islamic nation is like Turkey with such a beautiful past from the perspective of government, rulers and people; and is unique in history. The Turkish rulers got the opportunity to establish the greatest empire of the world. Such great empires have been discussed in stories but practically did not came into existence to the extent it came Turkey which is referred to as Ottoman Empire. This empire was established over three continents and big parts of three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa belonged to this Turkish Ottoman Empire. The Eastern Europe which is known as the Baltic region which comprises of around 15 to 20 countries were all part of Ottoman estate. Similarly in Asia all the Arab states including big part of Iran, central Asia, and northern Africa including Egypt were all part of Ottoman Empire. The pioneer of this empire was the person named Othman and this is the reason it was known as Ottoman Empire. He was a courages and wise person. He was a native from somewhere else who moved to Turkey. Turkey was the name given later first it was known as Anatolia. He came to Anatolia and established his kingship over part of it and then gradually started to spread it out. Then his children came who took it up to Arab, Iran, Africa and Europe.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="186" />This empire came into existence in 13th century. In 1299 Othman the first, established his rulership in a small part limited to a city which then spread out in one century across three continents and till 1922 at the end of First World War this empire existed. In 1922 it ended with the last Caliph Abdul Hamid who was revoked by a Turkish General and the entire family was exiled from turkey. In the First World War this empire got broken up because the Sultans of this empire supported Germany and hence the opposition alliance fought with Turkey and divided it amongst themselves. Some part went under Britain, some under France, some under Russia and some other states divided amongst themselves and what was left is only Turkey of today. The empire spreading out over three continents broke into what is left today as one nation of Turkey. The other states got free and from the era of First World War to Second World War these separated nations were colonies of Western countries. It is also a very interesting subject to know how Britain divided these lands into small countries and then gave governance of these small nations to certain families. They made Iraqi rulers, Jordan rulers, Palestine, Ale Saud came into power through them only and divided the Arab countries into small family ruled stated. This is a lessonful event which should be studied and today the difficulties which Muslims are facing what was its background.</p>\r\n<p>In 1922, the countries which were in opposition to Germany that is Britain, France and Russia defeated Germany as well as Ottoman Empire. After this the situation of Turkey became worst and anarchy took place there. Every region inside the empire went into rebellion resulting into inter regional battles within</p>\r\n<p>Turkey. Villages against villages, cities with cities, groups with groups and battles everywhere. When the central government collapsed and their dominance ended every group came out in rebellion creating a chaos across the nation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mustafa Kemal Pasha- Ata Turk</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/4.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="355" />At this instance a Turkish Army General, Mustafa Kemal who was formally part of Turkish army evolved. The last Ottoman Caliph had made him the General and he was delegated to unarm the regional rebellion groups. Mustafa Kemal was later dignified and Turks gave him a beautiful title of Ata Turk (Father of Turks). We know him as Mustafa Kemal Pasha and he was the part of the same defeated Turkish army.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The last Caliph who lost the battle and had lost control over the nation gave authority to this General to control the rebels. The General first finished the Caliph, exiled him and then started to suppress the rebellion. He unarmed the groups, attacked them, suppressed him and He achieved success day by day and whichever region he would go he established peace and very soon he got peoples acceptance. And very soon the same Turkey which was disturbed, unsafe, chaotic, unsecure with the efforts of General Mustafa Kemal Pasha Turkey became peaceful and he became hero of people. When he achieved popularity from people then formally in April 1923 he declared that Turkish Empire is over and he himself took the interim rulership. Then later he himself wrote a constitution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1924 the democratic constitution was made first time. Prior to this there were no laws or constitution when Kings were there because for Emperors whatever they say is a law. This army General declared Turkey as democratic governance and compiled a constitution. Turkey prior to Ottoman Empire was part of Roman territory and later they captured many Islamic lands which were primarily under Abbasid Caliphate. Ottomans defeated Rome and spread their territory and even defeated Iran. The rulers of Ottoman gave a dreadful defeat to Iranian king also and took some part of Iran. The current Iraq since long has been part of Iranian governance and they separated Baghdad and existing Iraq from Iran. The Ottomans snatched this current Iraq from Iran through battles. Such a powerful and complete force was that of Ottomans. It was first time in the world they made a naval fleet. In history the first use of ammunitions in battles was done by Ottomans; they made the first air force.&nbsp; This army which had a power ground army, naval fleet, air force and used explosives in battles was not possible was to be defeated. This itself becomes a topic on how such a big force spread over three continents got defeated and it is a very important chapter for student and today&rsquo;s youths, Muslims and have lessons to be learnt. By learning these lessons of history you will not get jobs but you will understand the path of salvation. You will come to know how communities are made, broken, dispersed, what mistakes are done, what kind of people come, what errors are done by rulers, politicians, what wrong steps are taken by masses, leaders, elites and from outside what planning is done by enemies whereby such a powerful nation falls down, breaks and disperses in a very small time. Since 1910 it started to disperse and in 1922 it got completely destroyed. We don&rsquo;t take up this lesson here as to what happened with Ottomans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Allama Iqbal says</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Uthmanio par kohe gam toota to kya gam hai,&nbsp; ke khoone Sad Hazar Anjum se hoti hai sahar paida</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If calamities have fallen over Ottomans, so what is it to get worried A dawn only comes up after the death of hundred thousand stars</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Erdogan is today claiming and trying to creating the dawn over Turkey. We will see whether he is the one or just claimant.</em></p>\r\n<p>Since 1923 the Pasha government started and was known under the name of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Democracy came, constitution was made and only Turkey remained (the current geography). Peace was established in Turkey and then reformatory acts were started by Mustafa Kemal Pasha. His reformation was that he took Turkey out from Eastern culture into Western culture and he was successful. At present Turks are a complete mirror of Western culture. He took many steps, brought many changes and reforms in economic, political, education arena and he changed the identity of Turkey. As per Quran he was the leader of an Aqabi Inquilab (Backward revolution). This backward revolution was that he made Muslims as Non-Muslims, he made people of east as western, religious as non-religious and he did that successfully. He was popular amongst people was a hero because he had established peace hence people liked him. He took advantage of his popularity amongst people. Economically also he gave stability to turkey because they had become poor, were starving and basic necessities were not available in Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The damage done by the Western nations at the end of the World War I was horrible in Turkey. They mercilessly subdued and brutally damaged the Ottomans specifically France and Russia. At present also the destructive power with Russia is highest and even more than America. They have this much potential and power and if they want to destroy something they can do it mercilessly. Turkey was also subdued mercilessly by Russia along with France through military power and then they distributed this territory into small parts. They made very small nations like Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain which are not even the size of city or district of Pakistan. Then they established those Arab families on them till date those families are loyal to them because they got this power from them. They are delivering the rights of this favor; Ale Saud, Ale Khalifa, Ale Sani and all these barbarous, Bedouin tribes who got the power are delivering the rights of this favor by doing treachery with their own people on the instructions of America and West.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Pasha government when they came into existence carried out reformation in Turkey. Since due to World War the government had become very weak and entire structure of Turkey had destroyed and national infrastructure was present, people had no strength to continue their routine life. Hence this person step by step went forward in bringing changes. Mustafa Kemal was a strategic and a highly capable person.&nbsp; Even Erdogan also has capabilities inside him and it is only such capable persons who do such things and not incapable persons. But at times useless, incapable persons are also brought in power by circumstances like what happens in Pakistan. A useless, foolish and worst person like Parvez Musharraf who was a General also ruled Pakistan for eight years. He had no capability inside him, neither positive nor negative. He was like a Robot and whatever his counselors would write and give him would present it without any thinking. We have seen then at the end what happened with him. He took stupid decisions. Zial ul Haqq was a deceptive person and Musharraf was not even near to the dust of his feet. It was the circumstances of Pakistan that imposed him on the people and then circumstances only bring him down. A Community whose destiny is in the hands of circumstances there people have no control on government and people do nothing. It is the circumstances that will make governments and bring down them. You can see in entire history no government is made or brought down in Pakistan by the community. It has been</p>\r\n<p>always governments coming due to circumstances and the circumstances are also not in the control of people. This community has compromised on everything, like load shedding of electricity is there but they don&rsquo;t show reactions and someone was saying when electricity goes off we go out for walking. This community is just busy in their lore and it is only the circumstances which bring changes and certain time circumstances bring useless persons as well in power.</p>\r\n<p>But some people have deception inside them and they get into a position with their cleverness. Erdogan has come up to this position on his own. He is very sharp and clever minded. He entered into a system which was concrete and was not allowing anyone to enter inside to bring a change but he entered it and changed it. Mostafa Kemal did the same way and he got a dispersed, ruined Turkey the same way Yemen is today. In fact Yemen would be still better as compared did what the forces in world war did with Turkey.&nbsp; That ruined turkey was managed by Mustafa Kemal. He united the dispersed regions inside this geography. He nurtured it, made a political system, economic system. The Empire that was spread on three continents, gets broken and then it becomes very difficult to take care of the left over. The left over ruins to be gathered and then casting a new nation out of it from scratch is done only by in ordinary people. They come under the category of architects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reformatory Steps of Mustafa Kemal (Ata Turk)</strong></p>\r\n<p>He took steps in phases. First he established peace. The anarchy inside Turkey after the world war was also due to the mistakes of Ottomans. When Ottomans were attacked by the alliances forces of France, Russia the ruling Ottoman kings, government armed the people and made a civil army to fight with Russia and France. They disposed arms to the people to fight France and Russia mainly because one end of Ottoman Empire was connected to Russia. The first thing Mustafa Kemal did was that he destroyed the armed groups and unarmed them. He captured some, arrested some and unarmed all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second thing he did after establishing peace he changed the structure of government. He transformed the imperial regime into democracy. He had to first educate the people on what democracy is because they were not used to it as they were living since centuries under emperors and kings. When America went to Afghanistan it was difficult for the Afghans to understand democracy and till today they are not able to make the Afghans understand democracy. The way it is very difficult to make Shia&rsquo;s understand what Imamat is similarly the people who have been living under kings it is very difficult to make them understand democracy. If a leader, teacher like Imam Khomeini (r.a) comes and makes the people living under Kings, Shahs for century to learn the lesson of Imamat is the greatness of this teacher. Allama Iqbal is also a great teacher but the class did not learn the lesson of Imamat which Iqbal taught them. And Iqbal also accepted that I could not teach the lesson to the community of this sub-continent and till date they are not able understand. In the Pasha regime the type and form of governance changed and the entire color of Turkish political system changed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The third thing he did was that he changed the way of living. He changed the culture, customs, civilization which is more difficult than the first two things. We are trying since five years to see that all students speak Urdu only but not successful. Now those who were speaking Urdu have also started to speak Balti language. To change habits, customs is a very tough thing which Mustafa Kemal did and changed. He transformed the eastern temperament to western. He changed standards of life, values and in reality these are unordinary people and such things do not happen with one speech or lecture. It was not that</p>\r\n<p>he delivered one speech and people changed. To change the people, masses from the ancestral system which they have taken since centuries and adopting new way of living is a difficult thing for centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>\r\n<p>Allama Iqbal says</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Aa&rsquo;ine nao darna, Tarze Kohan pe adhna ,&nbsp; Manzil yehi kathin hai kaumo ki zindagi me</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Being afraid of new trends, stubborn on old ways is the toughest stage in the lives of community</em></p>\r\n<p>They do not come out from the ancestral degradation. He changed the language and even the traditional script of language. Turkish was written in Arabic script before, he came and changed it to Latin. In few years all Turks old and young started to write Turkish with ABC, that is English letters. Today also if you go to Turks they cannot write Arabic letters, they write English.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/5.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="242" />The fourth thing which is the most hard which he did was to change the religion of people. He took them completely away from religion. He declared religion as forbidden for Turks. In Turkey majority are Sunnis and mostly Hanafi. In Ottoman era Turks were extremely religious and it was natural also as they were ruling the Islamic empire. It was due to Turks religion was being imposed on Arabs, Iranians and Africa. Turks were defenders of Islam and religion since centuries. A generation which since centuries has been strictly religion Mustafa Kemal made them non-religious and declared religion as forbidden. In 1924 the constitution was made and those make constitutions also are educated people possessing degrees. You should study who made the constitution of Pakistan, what was their level of education and what were their thinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since Turks were traditional people and since centuries were following certain customary trends. In Pakistan creating organizations is a beloved occupancy and we are experts in making organizations (Tanzeem). In one mosque there are various organizations, there is an Anjuman (group) of elders, youths, woman and everyone has separate president and secretary. To make an organization they write constitution and first thing they all write is that this org is made for establishing an Islamic society. The Turks also wrote in the constitution that the national and formal religion of Turkey is Islam. When even such a small statement is present in constitution it enough for religious people and the religious people can take advantage of this. In Pakistan constitution also if you see only this much is written that national religion is Islam but beyond this Islam is not seen but in judiciary, education and other systems of society. With this statement in constitution the religious people would get a justification for their activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This was the fourth thing which Mustafa Kamel did whereby in 1928 he amended the constitution and wiped off this statement that Islam is the national religion of Turkey. Turkey has no religion and it is secular state. People and even religious ones prayed for him. There was no protest even though scholars were also present but no one objected from inside or from outside. During the time of Mustafa Kamel everyone outside also wanted to establish relationship with him.</p>\r\n<p>Mustafa Kamel took a ruined nation and converted it into a role model. Then another General evolved in Iran. He was also an Army general. The situation in Iran was the same as that of Turkey towards the end of Qajar regime. The same situation happened with the Qajar regime whereby from outside Russia attacked and weakened Iran and from inside the movement of Mashrootiyat (Constitutional movement) started to make the King agree to the constitution. And due to internal rebellion, outside pressure and same situation developed in Iran and it also got into a state of anarchy. Every area developed a leader and got freedom for his area and battles started amongst them and Iran went into anarchy. Reza Khan was a junior officer in army and he was sent by Britain as a commander of an armed battalion to first establish peace in Tehran. He did the same and got control over all rebellion groups in Tehran. Today our rangers are busy in establishing in peace in Karachi but they are not successful. There is total chaos in Karachi, wherever every political group is armed and have made its force. The same situation was in Tehran.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reza Khan came to Tehran and established peace through his force. When Tehran became peaceful then different areas of Iran demanded to establish peace there also.&nbsp; Reza Khan went to different regions, arrested, killed and unarmed people and as a result Iran became peaceful and Reza khan became a hero of people. Anyone who heals the pain of a community becomes a hero instantly. Recently Abdul Sattar Edhi passed away in Pakistan and all Generals, politicians saluted him on his funeral. Such people became heroes. Reza khan also became a hero to the extent that he dismissed Shah of Iran and got his emperorship accepted by the Parliament. We have to remember that Parliament is a democratic setup and Kings don&rsquo;t have parliament. The people&rsquo;s represented parliament declared Reza Khan as the Shah, King of Iran and not even President. They gave an ancient special title to Reza Khan in respect as Pahlavi. Pahlavi were the ancient kings of Iran much before Islam who have ruled over entire Arab and Iran. The Parliament gave this title to a General because he established peace in the country and made him an emperor. This general Reza Khan even before becoming the emperor declared Ata Turk (Mustafa Kemal) as his role mode and declared that I will make Iran as turkey. He sent delegations and himself also went to Turkey, met Mustafa Kemal and asked him what is to be done. But Mustafa Kemal told him the opposite way. In Turkey first he did other things and then got people away from religion. But for Iran he told Reza Shah that your community is religious and hence first get them away from religion. He should get the beard of people trimmed, he should get the women unveiled, remove the turbans of scholars and close down religious centers.</p>\r\n<p>Mustafa Kemal had also closed all religious institutes in Turkey and handed them to army to place their horses there. Turkey was also center of religious knowledge and specifically the land of Turkey has been a center of knowledge, Sufism (Tassawuf) and even today those centers are present. Big Scholars came up from Turkish Madrassah&rsquo;s. The Turkish land has been the center of big Sufism (Tassawuf) but Mustafa Kemal terminated everything and all forms of religious centers he demolished. But for Iran he asked Reza shah to do this first and Reza Khan started from here. Mustafa Kamel changed things and eventually came to a stage where he asked people to leave religion if you want to progress. They removed their veil, chador and completely put over Western clothes. Though at that time used western clothes were not coming, but today Pakistanis are not ready to wear a modest Salwar but are ready to wear a used, impure tight pant of a West.&nbsp; Mustafa Kamel made the men, women nude and they went on becoming nude in the name of development. When Iranian General ordered the women did not do it, then he asked the forces to do this by force. When this happened, then the people, the veiled woman did an uprising against him and at the end he had to change his orders because government was under threat. In Iran also this General came and adopted the trend of Mustafa Kamel to bring changes.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/6.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="142" />In the Pasha governance these four things happened and the religion of Islam was formally removed and declared the country as secular and not Islamic. It is in the constitution of Turkey that it is not an Islamic state. There are 3 states naming it Turkey, Bangladesh and Iraq where it is written in their constitution that they are not Islamic states. The constitution of Iraq was made recently by religious people after Saddam went. It is written that the national religion will be Islam but not written that it is an Islamic state. For Pakistan it is written that it is an Islamic Republic but for Bangladesh it is not written. In these three countries majority are Muslims but it is there in their constitution that these are not Islamic state.</p>\r\n<p>The System of Pasha after changing the ruined Turkey and transforming its identity, bringing to Western style, made it a role model and in 1938 he died and even today he is considered as Ata Turk, the father of Turkey whereby all Turks respect him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Downfall of Islam in Turkey</strong></p>\r\n<p>After 1938 since democratic system was made, then parties were made which were all secular because formally religion was removed and all religious values were taken away. Here also the religious centers came under government and they made the syllabus for religious institutes. Here also in Pakistan the same is happening, the heads of madrassah have met government and agreed that the religious syllabus would be made by government, they want to experiment successful Turkish system in Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>By handing over Madrassah to government then in the entire government system of madrassah, what was kept was Salaat, Wudhu and from Quran only few surah&rsquo;s&rsquo; that are necessary for Salaat. You cannot teach Quran Tafseer, you cannot memorize it and you cannot teach religion beyond Ahkam of Salaat and Fasting. You will be astonished that Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a religious student but from Turkish Madrassah and has been Imam for prayers also. The Turkish Ulama if you see in the entire world they don&rsquo;t keep beard also and they don&rsquo;t have in their Fiqh also because they are secular. They don&rsquo;t want to be identified as religious in any way because the constitution of Turkey does not allow you to demonstrate that you are religious. The same Madrassah system syllabus which was made at the time of Mustafa Kamel Pasha is being experimented in Pakistan. Many times the scholars of Pakistan, the Tanzeemat-e-Madaris (Organization of Seminaries) including Shia Ulama have gone there and have seen Turkish Madrassah also. We don&rsquo;t know about others whether they liked it or not but Shia Ulama liked it a lot and want the Shias Madrassah in Pakistan to be like Turkish Madrassah. Here the situation in Pakistan has gone far ahead and to bring them to the state of Turkey is very difficult. You need someone beyond Mustafa Kamel Pasha to change the condition here (even in the direction of Turkish system).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The political parties kept on coming in Turkey but they were all secular and religious intervention was completely restricted in all affairs of life&rsquo;s including schools, colleges, universities and there were no religious teachings imparted in these places. The religious madrassa also were restricted only 2 yrs. of education and then you become Imam and state will pay you stipends also. You cannot wear Hijab, keep beard so that you are not seen as religious. This was the system made by Mustafa Kamel which continued from 1938 to 1980.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During this time the few secular parties kept on making governments. During this period two armed rebellion also took place; one in 1960 and other in 1980 and these were severely extreme bloody coup that took place and rulers were caught, arrested, killed and their followers were sieged seriously. The reason for the coup was that the army found a slight inclination towards religion in some of these ruling parties. At times if someone has religion in his heart, unintentionally like a Bismillah comes out in some speech. Erdogan himself was inside prison for two years, when he was a parliament representative for reading a poem of an Islamic poet in his speech and restrictions were imposed on him to come in parliament. Those two coup were not velvet revolution they were true rebellions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/7.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="141" />This continued and since in the constitution they have written that it is secular state hence they closed the doors of religion in Turkey. In Turkey to be religious was declared as crime and also it got written in constitution that army is the defender of border and also the constitution. In every country there is an organization who defends and protects the constitution of the nation like in Pakistan it is Supreme Court. In some states like America, Senate is the protector of constitution.&nbsp; In Iran, the organization responsible for protecting the constitution is not Supreme court , Parliament or Senate instead it is Shura e Nigahban Kanoone Asase, whose General Secretary is Ayatullah Jannati. In Turkey the protector of constitution is army. With these rights, the Turkish army has become a unique army in the world with abnormal rights, authority and steps to be taken. They have to ensure that the community should not become religious. The moment this force realizes that the nation is getting religious inclination they have to come forward to protect it. When the force is responsible for protecting the constitution also apart from borders, now they have control over politicians and parliaments as well. For instance if a politician has a baby born and he recites Salawat in the birthday party or something very small religious, they will take action against this for sacrilege of Turkish values and they will get this person and party out and bring a secular person. The secular system of Turkey is the most severely extreme form in the world. They are like ISIS, Al Qaeda extremists who do not tolerate their opponents other than just killing and destroying them. This secular force has the same form of extremism. In other parts of the world also secularism is present but not to the extent of extremity which is present in Turkey. This politics went on till the 70s and till now this extremist secularism is there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual law of extremism</strong></p>\r\n<p>Under this secular shadow, below the ground one more issue started. This is an intellectual rule which communists took advantage of. The Scholars write, that when something crosses its limit, it turns into its contradiction of opponent. They give an example of water; the temperature of cooling and heating of water has a limit. If water remains within the limit it remains as water, but the moment it crosses its limits, then by one degree it turns into vapor, the opponent. If it remains within limits and even if it is hot, that is up to 100 degree Celsius is the boiling point of water, then it turns into gas. This is one example and like this there are many other examples. This is a law of physics and also a cosmic, philosophic law. Some interpreted this in the social world as well where the laws are not Takwini (by creation) instead they are</p>\r\n<p>Tashree (through a prescribed set of laws). Like they say in friendship when it crosses limits it turns into enmity, if your voice remains in limits it will be sweet but if it crosses limits it will be disturbing. These things some applied in society. The social scholars like Karl Marx, Engel and his followers like Lenin, from this law they made a policy for history. They said that this is half law, not complete and said that the complete law is that, &ldquo;Everthing nurtures its antidote (contradiction) inside itself&rdquo;. This is a law of communist and not aspect by any scholar of physics or philosophy. Everything nurtures its contradiction, antidote and when that grows, it conflicts with the thing, and this new thing becomes dominant. They gave example that inside the capitalist system its contradiction gets developed and results into a revolution. They presented the vision in Revolution. There is a question why revolution takes place in the world? In Pakistan this is not applicable. If you find out the reason you will find very interesting results for Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>The law of communism is not intellectual, logical and not acceptable but the actual principle is that everthing when crosses limits it transforms itself into its own contradiction. The communism law intellectually is a shameless principle, which is much below intellectual level.</p>\r\n<p>What happens is that whenever there is any dictatorship, till the time he does cruelty within limits, it can go on for centuries. The day it crosses limits it will turn into its own enmity. In family when you do extremism on children and cross limits, it will turn into its contradiction. This is because limits means ends, there is no nothing beyond it. Like this table has a limit, beyond this there is no table; it has ended and there is something else beyond it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Religious wave within Secular Turkey by Necmettin Erbakan</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/8.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="126" />Secularism means being unconcerned from religion but Turkish Secularism is end of religion, enmity with religion, attacks on religion that too with extremism. As a result of this within Turkish community, underground religious groups and personalities got developed. Amongst these religious personalities one well known personality who got developed underground was Necmettin Erbakan who passed away in 2011. This person was a religious person, has studied in the same Madrassah and was under Taqaiyya (dissimulation). Necmettin Erbakan made a group underground and before that he found his Qiblah of thoughts which was the mother of all religious organizations that is Muslim brotherhood whose pioneer was Hassan ul Banna in Egypt. He was thinker and leader of thoughts in Egypt. He made this party, then government at the time of Jamal Abdul Nasser arrested him and executed him, then his successor Syed Qutub came as Muslim Brotherhood leader and he was also arrested and executed by Jamal Abdul Nasser. Jamal Abdul Nasser was an Egyptian leader and was like Mustafa Kamel. He was also a soldier and part of Muslim brotherhood. He terminated the Egyptian government with the help of Muslim brotherhood and then after coming to power he went against Muslim Brotherhood. This organization is almost a century old and many organizations across the world were born through this group. In Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami is its child. All these groups are considered as children of Muslims Brotherhood. That is a different discussion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The thing that is proven is that inside the extremist secular layer of Turkey a religious wave started underground in which the manifested personality was of Necmettin Erbakan. He was a wise person, one was that he was impressed with Hassan ul Banna. He had a big achievement that under such extreme secularism he got his nation inclined towards religion. This was an act of valor and the most courage he got for this movement came from the Islamic revolution and Imam Khomeini (r.a). He was not a Shia and accidentally in Turkey there is a high degree of extremism against Shia. Mustafa Kamel had extreme hatred towards Shiite and his successors also the same.&nbsp; Erbakan was not seen as an enemy of Shias but was also not that much admired by Shia. When Imam appeared, his determination went up and since he was a professor picked up the revolution very quickly and spread this movement underground. He made a beautiful underground infrastructure whereby he educated people, trained youths religiously and very soon he entered the political arena. He himself was an educated person and a profession. The generation which he nurtured amongst them was Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In his youth age Erdogan who comes from a simple family became part of the Erbakan movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since Erbakan was also not a culturally religious person but instead a follower of Hassan ul Banna. That is a different story like in Pakistan also there is a cultural religion but you can see within this cultural religion a tree of visionary people also like Maulana Maudoodi stems out. He was also a unique scholar and presented a visionary religion to the masses. The atmosphere of Pakistan is not a serious, suitable place to study, analyze and everything goes by prejudice, propaganda and rumors also. Like a Shia personality will not study Sunni and Sunni will not study Shia. He was a unique scholar who was completely unaware of Shiite that too in this century. This is also a miracle of Maulana Maudoodi who was such an enlightened person but still completely ignorant about Shias. He also got the froth from Muslim Brotherhood from Egypt and you know what capital and assets he created for his community but later the hands in which these assets passed on you know that as well what treatment they have done with it. This also happens with such guides that their power hungry successors do such kind of oppression on the work of visionary leaders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/9.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="202" />Erbakan had an unordinary association with religion. The people whom he nurtured also developed inside them a passion, motivation that they got prepared to rise against an extreme secular state of Turkey. And Erdogan was from this group.&nbsp; Erbakan made almost ten political groups and whenever he would make a party they would attack, arrest and put Erbakan inside jail. He would come out and make another party, and like this he made many political parties. And the last political group he made in which Erdogan was involved was Felicity Party (SAADAT Percisi) and later Erbakan fought election and also became the Prime Minister. The one who broke the spell of secularism of Turkey was Erbakan and made the ground for Erdogan and not that he inherited to him.</p>\r\n<p>One more personality who is also popular in Turkey but not associated with the Muslim brotherhood Ideology but instead with Sufism is Fethullah Gulen. His name is now going in media and Erdogan is accusing him of the coup. He has many schools, madrassah across the world and his thinking is like Sir Syed Ahmad khan, to make religion as a tool. He has schools in Pakistan also by the name of Pak-Turk schools. He has schools across the world where several thousands of children are studying. He is in America under refuge and Turkish government is asking him to be returned. Erdogan also had relationship</p>\r\n<p>with him. When Erdogan came into power Gulen went to America and from America he is running his network. When Erdogan came to Pakistan he demanded from Pakistani government to shut down the schools (Pak Turk School). If you remember few years back I have told that you will listen in near future a lot of news from Turkey. Turkey has now become a victim of incident and is now moving in that direction. In this movement of Turkey at present Erdogan has certain things which are part of his thoughts and certain things are his personal traits. Some of them are.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Traits and Strategies of Erdogan</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/10.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="140" />One is that he desires to acquire esteemed positions. If you see in history big encounters are done by those in pursuit in reaching esteemed positions in the world. If you see Einstein he had the same trait and if he was not after reaching esteemed position, he would not have become scientist instead would have been just small school teacher. Some people are such that who do not like small things, small jobs, small money instead they have this desire to fight big encounters. If they become part of evil world there also they strive to reach high positions in evil sense. In intellectual field also those who reach esteemed status were those who were not contented by reading one small book. They strive to acquire esteemed positions. Some are satisfied with even matriculation. Some are such that they do not stop at small levels of education whereas some don&rsquo;t even want to be educated themselves and their generations. Like these Marajae who had big difficulties in life much more than the theology students of this era but they wanted to acquire esteemed position. Like Modi is such a person similarly Erdogan is such type of person who is not contented with the positions he got, he is in pursuit of higher positions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Erdogan has this desire to become the Emperor of an Ottoman Empire that is Sultan Erdogan. He wants to again revive the same Turkey but under the color of Erdogan and he would be the Caliph of this revived Ottoman Empire. He was first the mayor of Istanbul but was not satisfied. He took advantage of that position and went ahead to become parliament member; then he went further ahead and became Prime Minister, then he became President. He considers President also small and wants to become Sultan Erdogan. The Presidential palace he has made for himself is not made for President but for future when he becomes the Sultan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He has absolute egoism in him; which means he is not ready to share power with anyone else. Absolute egoism in a person means every opinion should be his only and no one should deny his opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He is extremely deceptive and opportunist. Opportunist are those like businessman who find during incidents and tragedies also opportunity. During floods they will find new ways of business rather than thinking how to save lives. They do not let go any opportunity out of their hand. Opportunist always take every case as an opportunity to climb the ladder. He is most deceptive. Today if you count the top 10 deceptive persons then Erdogan would be in that. He has extremism and the vision of Muslim brotherhood with which he is associated is itself an extremist vision. All the organizations that came out of Muslim Brotherhood had some form of extremism inside them. Their leaders have done such kind of education</p>\r\n<p>and exposition of religion that they see everyone else as infidels. The extremism comes out from this vision and these Takfirists have come out form this vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Erdogan is merciless and for his own mission, agenda he is not ready to forgive anyone whether his relatives or friends.</p>\r\n<p>The strategy he has adopted is that the country should grow and develop so that he gains peoples confident. He has made turkey economically very strong. There is an international political policy that those countries who want their own development and growth they do not interfere in the affairs of other nations. It is like China, Brazil, Korea, Japan, and Germany who never interfere in the affairs of others. These countries have been successful in growth but they do not have any role in the global affairs. They are traders and they even go to poorest, helpless nations of the world to find opportunities. They even go to helpless nations and find opportunities there. If some calamity strikes some country they become happy as it opens up doors for new business opportunities for them. They take advantage of the ruining of other nations for their own national growth.</p>\r\n<p>Erdogan took this strategy. He spent his Ministerial period in development of this country. Though there were battles going on around him in Iraq but he did not interfere and developed his nation and through it got the confidence of the people. Now the next strategy was to move further towards emperorship by expanding his territory. Whenever the rulers of a country develops these thoughts of interfering in the affairs of other nations it means they are expanding their territory and moving towards emperorship. The national growth is no more their target. This is a law that whenever a nation interferes with others they will not develop themselves. The Pakistani rulers till the time they interfere in the affairs of other nations they will never progress. Though they consider China as their lord but they do not follow China who is only concerned about developing their nation. They say if someone is dying we will start to manufacture shrouds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/11.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="298" />Erdogan has started to take steps towards emperorship and becoming Sultan. He started to interfere in other nations, in Iraq Syria, Greece, and Azerbaijan and started to get indulged with other states. The most stupid step he took was his interference in Syria and there all his calculations went wrong. All the issues in Syria, Erdogan is responsible for that. He nurtured ISIS in Turkey and he was expecting in few weeks Syria will be finished, then we will wipe off ISIS since ISIS has no national base and Syria will become part of Turkey, at least Kurdistan of Syria. In Pakistani terminology, the stupidity which Zia ul Haqq did as a policy of strategic depth. First Pakistan adopted this policy and got stuck and now Turkey did this for Syria. Till now if you see the Turkish forces are sitting in Iraq and not going out, though the Iraqi government, Marajae are telling them to leave. He wants to make Turkey the most powerful, decisive nation in the Middle East.</p>\r\n<p>One strategy he adopted was that of nationalism. Certain communities in the world are highly communal, like Germans are highly communal and believe only in German essence. Similarly Turks, Iranians have extreme degree of nationalism. Erdogan has fueled Turkish communalism so that he can again revive the Ottoman Empire. He is flaming, arousing the Turks to prepare for that big encounter. America has its own</p>\r\n<p>planning for the region whereas Arabs are their slaves. Erdogan even though he is member of NATA but still has his own strategy. He is thinking that at present Arab and Iran are at war, so let me take advantage of the situation. He changes stance every day, he knows to play around. One day he will make relationship with Israel, next day he will break. One day he will bring down the aircraft of Russia then next day he will apologies. One day he will issue a strong statement to Iran then next day he comes down for settlement. Now for Syria also he gave a soft statement that we will stop interference and the issue of Syria will be resolved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One more thing he does is that he crushes severely his opponents. He carves enemies for himself. Such position, power pursuing leaders need the support of people. When will a community support such leaders who are seeking high position? One is when you develop the communal spirit inside them and another is create artificial enemies and keep them always alert that your enemies are coming towards you. You see the deception of Erdogan that on one hand he is fully supportive of America and now he is saying America has created this coup. He is conveying the message to Turks that America is your enemy and it wants to destroy you so that the blood of Turks boils that America is our enemy and then they will accept everything what Erdogan says. If he tells them to come out they will come out. He is issuing anti American statements every day that whoever is supportive of Gulen is our enemy. He is busy today with carving enemies and creating self-made enemy. America also does the same and creates hypothetical enemies. They create enemies like ISIS, Al-Qaeda with their own money and then tells the world that see they are our enemies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Military Coup</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/12.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="147" />One more objective of Erdogan is that since Turkish Army is secular and they like power. This force has tasted power and will never separate from power. Erdogan created a religious inclination and thus aroused the Turkish army. Erdogan has big threat from Army and as a result of this threat he was sure that an army coup would happen. He took an advance step and replicated a fraudulent coup before the predicated actual coup and thus narrowed down the actual coup. The Turkish army had this sense they were preparing for a rebellion, and he washed it. The rebellion which was about to happen will not happen now so soon. He is also saying that there is still a threat of army rebellion. The rebellion which was supposed to happen did not happen and what happened was a created one. He took the initiative and created a deceptive drama in very beautiful way since he is deceptive and merciless.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He created a strange drama and informed some groups of Army that there is a Military drill which happens in every country. This is very common that Military drills happen to prepare for catastrophes. He told the Turkish Army battalion to carry out Army drill and asked them to move out in friendly manner. You would have seen in video clips that Military tanks were moving and also public movement was all normal. Then he asked them to park their tanks in certain positions like airports. He selected a midnight time and then immediately a weak announcement was made on TV that coup has happened, a committee is about to be established and government is coming down. Then he announced on mobile phone for people to come out on street.&nbsp; People at midnight came on street. Say for example you are asked to come out at midnight you might not be having a proper dress ready to wear forget about carrying national flags. If everyone</p>\r\n<p>coming out has a flag in their hands. The army did not fire anyone except a few which was a number planned to be killed. People got the soldiers out from the tanks and beat them with shoes. The army was himself was astonished as to what they have done, were just carrying out a military drill.&nbsp;&nbsp; They played this drama overnight and in few hours this drama coup got ended. Then immediately they declared that this was done by Gulen</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/13.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="164" />This was all a drama to prevent the actual military coup which will still happen but taking this step Erdogan has delayed the actual coup. By taking this step Erdogan has inflicted a very powerful blow to the army. And not just this it is first time in front of the world he disgraced the Turkish army first time in the history of Turkey. He took all the revenge from the army which he had in his heart and made people slap the forces on street in front of everyone. In the name of this coup, he has arrested hundreds of thousands of people like Journalists, writers, hoteliers, drivers and all those who are his opponent and does not abide by his thinking they are arresting them. They will impose punishments on their opponents and this way he will crush this opponent. After this coup Erdogan&rsquo;s power has multiplied several times in the country and he has become hero with the help of media.</p>\r\n<p>In politics this thing happens. Whenever a movement starts against a government there are many ways to crush that movement. One way is to send a force and crush the opposition movement. This is done by insane rulers that they arrest the leaders of their opposition, put them inside prison but this is an act of stupidity because with this the revolutionary movements further pick up and gets more passionate. A clever ruler will never do this. They create an artificial, fraudulent movement against the actual movement from the government funding. This dummy movement will run by the funding of government and will also oppose the government. The benefit of such methodology is that the passion of actual movement leaks out. A dummy movement comes out, does protests, put their demands, demands are accepted and everything cools down for some time and government gets another opportunity. But when an actual movement calls people out, then the masses complain how many times we have to come out and they are not ready to come out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is a government tactic to make false, dummy parties, personalities, alliances like Parvez Musharraf himself made Muttahid-a-Majalise Amal (MMA) with his own hands. When the funding of government this group was in opposition to Parvez Musharraf. He became President with the single vote of MMA. In voting casting for him to become President from the position of CEO he was falling short of one vote which was given to him by MMA which was his opposition. This was a friendly opposition and they would raise the slogan of Go Musharraf Go, but when the time for voting came this MMA gave a casting vote to make the decision. When election happens, a party makes another opposition from their own party to show people he is my opponent.&nbsp; In Iran, Rafsanjani made his own employee, Jasibi who was a vice chancellor of his own Open University stand against himself in Presidential election and they would speak against each other and due to this Rafsanjani won the election with 98%. If someone else would have come like Ahmadinejad he would have defeated him. In order to stop people like Ahmadinejad he created a friendly opposition and this act happens every other day in the global politics.</p>\r\n<p>The policy of Erdogan in this velvet rebellion was to get bloodshed to a limited level and then after this by arresting people he is taking it to the next step. Today one more doctrine that is applied everywhere in the world is 9/11 strategy. Everyone has learnt this and even India has learnt it. The strategy is to break your own head with your own hands and then throw the stone in your neighbor&rsquo;s house and then get him arrested. In the 9/11 incident America broke their own head with a brick and then threw that brick in Afghanistan that Al Qaeda has done this. Then in order to catch Al Qaeda America destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen and till now Al Qaeda is being capture. This is a 9/11 strategy to hit yourself and then attack your enemy. There is a very simple way to judge this which is to see whenever an incident happens just see who is getting the most benefits and the one who gets the maximum benefit is responsible for the incident. In 9/11 incident America got the maximum benefits and Muslims suffered the most, hence Muslims did not do it. In this coup also the benefits are all for Erdogan. He attacked himself and then blamed that this has been done by military, America and so and so group. He would have taken several decades to become such a powerful ruler which he has become overnight by this coup. He is arresting anyone who could be his opponent in future or is his opposition.&nbsp; He has arrested thousands of judges and anyone whom he finds is dangerous for him might be doctor, teacher and anyone for whom he has even a slight possibility could be a threat for him he has arrested in context of this coup. This coup has given full benefits to Erdogan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/14.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="169" />If a person targets his opponents politically the world will make noise but if they are arrested in the crime of rebellion everyone his remain silent. If he would have arrested these many opponents without this coup there would have been strong reaction from inside as well as outside. Now in the name of rebellion he is comfortably crushing down all his opposition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One more thing he has done is that he suspended the constitution and declared emergency in country. During rebellion and state of emergency the constitution is suspended and an emergency constitution is applied. The future opponent of Erdogan that is Gulen who was once his friend is now a big opposition. He has big threat from Fethullah Gulen and if Erdogan is afraid of someone that is Gulen. This is because Gulen also wants to become an Emperor and hence repeatedly he takes his name as responsible for this coup. Erdogan is very clever; from being a mayor he went on going upwards in position and reached this state. But he has done acts of stupidity as well. One of these stupid acts is his interference in Syria, another stupidity was to nurture ISIS in his own laps and now crushing his opposition with this dummy coup is another act of stupidity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/15.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" />Now the future circumstances show that situations will change fast in Turkey and the actions that were planned to be taken against Erdogan might happen quicker because his opposition has also made arrangements and they will now speed up. All these foolishness which he has done which gather together inside him. His opposition countries like Syria, Russia want Turkey to be chaotic. They were waiting for this moment and he has given this moment. One on hand he has done a worst act in Syria by creating ISIS and now with this dummy coup these links will join and with ISIS an extreme situation</p>\r\n<p>will get created against him and it might be difficult for him to survive. Though after the rebellion he has tried to change his tactic and has sent messages to Syria, Iran, and Iraq that we want to restore relationship and not interfere with you. But the rulers of these nations are also not stupid and blind that they will get trapped by these words. They understand his tactic and these links will join and Erdogan will get indulged into big chaos and there will be fast changes in Turkey. Now this will not be one sided which he has been doing now, but now the opposition will also plan unitedly to uproot him.&nbsp; The incidents for which Turkey is getting prepared will affect the entire Middle East and specifically Pakistan as well. The Pakistani state has tied itself with the tail of Turkey and now we will also be tossed up along with them. In Iran there is a parable, to catch fish from filthy water. America has made the water filthy in Middle East and before they could catch fish from this dirty water Erdogan wanted to catch fish. But this dirty water will drown them because against them is the planning of Allah and dominating. The plan of Allah is whatever enemy thinks against the path of Allah, Allah drowns him in his own plan. If you see under divine planning as to what is happening around Syria are all arrangement being made for the annihilation of this devilish tree of Ale Saud and the oppressed will get salvation from them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Translated By Syed Arif Rizvi</p>', 'Y', 'N', '15166029681511329775Erdogan.jpg', '', '', 'A', NULL, '2018-05-04 16:12:55', 'Y');

Whatever is happening in Saudi are all in a dramatic way since last two or three years. In fact from the time Salman became the King and his accursed son Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince Saudi has changed its policies dramatically. Saudi had already worsened their situation but these two; father and son have deviated from the conventional Saudi politics and adopted a new political way. Until now Saudi had family rule and it was always Ale Saud which as a family was ruling the country even though king was one person but they have divided the country amongst family members. The wealth, oil, politics and all affairs of the state was under family and they were not giving any authority to anyone outside the family unless it became a must. Everything was exclusive to this family and the family as such is also very big. The host of this family had twenty one wives so you can imagine how many children were there. It is a big family and even after dividing the entire country it was less. All the predecessor rulers who came they maintained the policies of Royal family. When King Faisal was there, which you won’t remember but two signs of his are present in Pakistan; one is the King Faisal mosque which he donated and the city of Faisalabad where he invested a lot and was renamed in his name. He was a very powerful ruler of Saudi Arabia but he maintained the family rulership by distributing the authorities. Then Khalid came, then Fahd and then Abdullah came. Abdullah also inherited the same family principles and ruled according to that involving the entire family in power and wealth. But the current ruler Salman is the most accursed in this family as such everyone in this family is accursed but Salman even when he was not in power; Salman was the most accursed. He was the one supporting the religious group and was the pioneer of Takfirism. When he was the governor of Riyadh from that time he had these thoughts to have zero tolerance aginst Shias. Abdullah was a politician and to a certain extent he was known as a liberal ruler in Ale Saud. He was not believing and acting on many religious thoughts. Hence during his rulership Iran and Saudi had friendly relationships. He came to Iran as well and Rafsanjani went to Saudi Arab during his tenure.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img2_1.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="207" /></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>This was because of his liberal thinking. Salman was against him even at that time.  The current ruler in a way is expired and retired. He has a sickness of Alzheimer which in Pakistani references we can say of Load shedding. In this sickness for some moment the mind of a person switches off for some moments. He forgets everything during that moment and then with medicines he recovers. Hence practically the ruler is his son and he is only a demonstration and for signing documents. His son, Mohammad bin Salman is a world seeker and highly immature, insane and foolish. If such a fool gets power, authority, wealth he turns out to be the most dangerous person. His weaknesses are known to others like America and Israel. They have selected him only and now this kingdom has come out of the family state into an individual rulership. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Transformation from family to individual emperorship</strong></p>\r\n<p>Now Ale Saud are not the rulers it is Mohammed bin Salman; one member of this family who is the ruler and he has deprived everyone else from the family. He has taken power, wealth from them. He has arrested, punished some; some are killed, some are besieged some inside home, hotels and some of them who were outside the country are not returning and Mohammed bin Salman has seized all their assets. He has closed down their companies, bank accounts and taken everything under his control. The family is no more a part of the rulership.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img3_1.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="375" /></p>\r\n<p>This is not the outcome of his personal thoughts; these are being dictated to him by the American Satan’s. The emperorship is of different faces; one is family, second is delegated and third is individualistic. The worst emperorship is this individual one whereby even his family is not included in this. They are going towards that governance which was not experienced before. Neither the people are acquainted there and nor was the structure present there. In order to make this new structure they have to bring down the old structure and to some extent that is done but more has to happen. He will do more blood shedding and extremism on his family members now. The politics which he has adopted in the political science is known as Spider Politics.  In spider politics a web is made to trap others but the spider dies by getting trapped in the same web. Every spider gets trapped in its web which it makes to trap other insects. The spider web which he has made is that he has taken steps simultaneously outside the country and inside country as well he has started many foolish things. </p>\r\n<p><strong> 2. Economic reformation from rental state to western welfare state</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img4_1.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="259" />One is in the name of reformatory actions he has transformed the rental state. Rental state is where the people are given one part of government share not as a compensation for doing something but instead they are given to remain unconcerned with the politics and government. They should just enjoy and not interfere in any state affairs. All Arab states where these Sheikhs are ruling like Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, Oman and Emirates are rental states. The states sell the national wealth like oil and they distribute some part of earning amongst people as rights for remaining silent. You have to remain unconcerned from state affairs and monthly compensations are given with free electricity, oil, tickets for foreign travel and these people don’t do any work. This is the rental state and in these rental states the people only live on free income from state and they don’t do any work for the country. If you see in these countries you will see all Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan who do everything. The local Arabs only enjoy their lives and without any hardships they get earnings.   Now when you change the structure of this system and bring them to a state where the people have to work, drive cars, do labor and then they are given salary and from that salary as well tax is deducted. In welfare states the government does not give anything to the people, they give opportunity to people for working and then they pay salary to people and from that they remove tax and run the nation. In an economic reformation without any study and preparation of ground he is trying to change the rental state to welfare state by an order. How is it possible that those who were eating free come to work in a day, take salary and from that salary pay forty percent as tax as well to government? This is the economic politics which he has started to create a western style state which has no possibility there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Commanding a dream force of thirty four Muslim nations </strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img5_1.jpg" alt="" width="388" height="235" />On the other hand he has taken this step of creating a force of thirty four nation’s alliance and he will command that force. This is also among those foolish acts. He issued a command, neither did he visit those countries; but just written their names that this is the force. He will give monthly Rials and some accepted that like this Pakistan General who left his country and became a slave of this filthy prince. What could be more disgrace which Allah could give someone? He was the number one of Pakistani force and now he is a slave of this filthy prince. America made a NATO which has become difficult to maintain and has broken. Turkey has come out of this and EU has made their own NATO; they have got the law of European defense force and America and Canada will not be part of it.  America was not able to manage NATO and this crazy prince will manage this force by just issuing commands.   </p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Aggression on Yemen</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img6_1.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="211" />The moment he came into power he started aggression on Yemen to demonstrate his power. He purchased new weapons and in the history of weapons sale Saudi has purchased the maximum and whatever Europe and America made they have purchased all. Now they attacked Yemen and that too with the help of Rials. He attacked Yemen tribe who don’t even have proper dress to cover their body and no footwear. Yemen was a poor nation and they attacked it but still he could not win the battle since three years with these tribal people; that too with such big weapons. Now it has reversed when Yemen has launched Scud missile on Riyadh Airport. This has changed the game. When a missile is hitting Riyadh airport this means none of the Saudi points are secure. They replied that Iran has hit this and Trump also said I have seen that Iran has done this. </p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Conflict with Qatar</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img7_1.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="151" />He was in need of global support to resolve Yemen crisis but instead he went into opposition with Qatar. He got few countries with him and he made his own arm of Qatar as his enemy. This was one more step of this spider politics.      </p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Interference in Politics of Lebanon – Saad Hariri’s forced resignation</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img8_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336" /></p>\r\n<p>Now the most laughing step he has taken is interference in Lebanon politics. He called the Lebanese Prime Minister, arrested him and made him resign in Riyadh. Saad Hariri was invited and he told him to resign and he also did that under pressure. This is a unique incident in the world that the Prime Minister of one country is giving resignation sitting in another country. He should have resigned inside Lebanon but he has done this in Saudi Arabia and now he is not ready even to return to Lebanon. They are trying to play this gamble in Lebanon as well. By using his childish mind he has done this planning. In Syria; America, Europe, Saudi, Turkey all got brutally bashed by Iran. They got bashed by that country whose borders are also not touching Syria. They got bashed in a disgraceful manner. In Syria, Iraq the bashing which Iran has done to these nations which in village example is when a donkey passes into the field of a farmer, the way that donkey is bashed with batons, sticks to the extent that the donkey is made to run beaten to its owners house. Iran has done the same thing with their donkey in Syria, Iraq and made it bleed running to the doors of the owner and the owner realized that it’s not their donkey but it they themselves who have been badly bashed. Now both Trump and Mohammed bin Salman want to take revenge from Iran and they are getting crazy about this. They have put this much capital in Syria, Iraq and made ISIS force but they have beaten us so badly and why can’t they control Iran. Trump is trying to put more sanctions to control Iran and this Spiderman Mohammed bin Salman has been sent out to tackle Iran. He has been beaten by Iran in Syria and in Lebanon he wants to beat Iran. You should know about Lebanon that it is a unique country in the world in context of its political structure, strategic importance and many other aspects. There are three big populations, communities residing in Lebanon. They are Christians, Sunnis and Shias; there is a fourth small community of Druze as well whose leader is Walid Jumblatt but since they are small they affiliate with any of these three. Due to this distribution the situation of Lebanon has been disturbed since long and has been unstable. As per the censuses done in 1932 the Christians were majority, then Sunnis and then Shias. It was at that time but there is a difference in this distribution hence current precise figures are not there. The effect of this distribution was on the politics and the power positions have been distributed based on this. The President has to be Christian, the Prime Minister Sunni and the head of Parliament will be Shia. It is like this only now whereby Michel Aoun is the Christian President. He was head of Christian militia during the 80’s and they had heavy battles with Hezbollah and Michelle Aoun was defeated and for a long time he escaped to France then returned back. At that time they were staunch enemies to Hezbollah. But now Michelle Aoun is the President, Saad Hariri the son of Rafiq Hariri who was assassinated in car bomb blast is the Prime Minister. Nabih Berry is the commander of Amal movement and is now the head of Parliament. They were all armed battle groups. Lebanon is divided in these three populations and even geographically they live separately inside Lebanon.  The entire affairs of Lebanon are under control of three countries. France is effective and influential on the Christian population of Lebanon. The second is Saudi Arabia which is effective on Sunni and Iran on Shias. These three countries are effective, influential on their communities inside Lebanon. The battles that took place inside Lebanon historically were first between Christians and Shias; then Sunni, Shias and then even within Shias where Nabih Berry Amal militia were fighting with Hezbollah. Then Shia, Sunni fought with Christians. We can also say that there is a fifth community in big numbers present inside Lebanon; they are the Palestinian refugees in camps which are like colonies but known as camps and they are under Abbas Mahmoud control.  As an outcome of these battles that weakest population which was Shias before these battles; the Christians were the most powerful, then Sunnis but during these battles even though the Shias were beaten badly but they became very powerful. At this moment there is only one decisive power in Lebanon and that is Shias and that too Hezbollah. There are two political groups of Shias; one is Amal party and Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a force and very powerful in Lebanon. This is the reason that all groups remain coordinated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the arm of Iran hence in other words the decision position in Lebanon is Iran. The war in Syria was also for this reason to cut the route of Iran to support Hezbollah. They wanted to cut this supply line and make a Takfirist route but that donkey got beaten. Now they want to clash with Iran in Lebanon. Iran is very far geographically from Lebanon and there is Iraq and Syria in between.  In Lebanon they created panic; the Sunni Prime Minister was called, arrested, asked to resign so that the government in Lebanon collapses. The reason for the resignation announced was that a plot to assassinate Saad Hariri was made by Iran and Hezbollah. They wanted to make this issue a global issue and take this issue to global organizations. During Rafiq Hariri’s time Syria had high influence in Lebanon and Syrian army was formally present in Lebanon and they had control over entire Lebanon. To get this control of Syrian forces out they had made this plot to assassinate Rafiq Hariri and put the blame on Syria. Then an investigation was done by UN and they proved that Syria and Hezbollah did this. It was not Syria who did this but they put the blame on Syria. Saudi got a resolution passed out in UN that Syria should come out of Lebanon and if they do not come out then all nations under American leadership should attack Syria. Syria was forced to remove their forces out from Lebanon and when Syria got the forces back to Syria and then they created a rebellion inside Syria. This first experiment of theirs was successful whereby they first got Rafiq Hariri the father of Saad Hariri assassinated, then put the blame on Syria, threatened Syrian government and got Lebanon empty. Now when Syria was out they were certain that Lebanon will come under their control. But this did not happen, Hezbollah became more powerful despite of Syria out from there. Hezbollah was not participating in Lebanese Politics and they were only an armed force. But when Syria went out they started to participate in the politics to have a strong grip. </p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img9_1.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="405" /></p>\r\n<p>Hezbollah came into power to confront Israel when Israel had totally controlled Beirut and it was Hezbollah who got them out from there. The actual target of Hezbollah is Israel and they are not concerned about internal affairs of Lebanon. If they leave Hezbollah on their own and not fiddle with them Hezbollah will not participate in elections. Hezbollah decided to participate into elections when they made this plan to finish Hezbollah. They wanted to pressurize Hezbollah, declare them as terrorist and finish them completely. Then Hezbollah started this act of getting into state politics at that time so that the government should not stab them from behind. As a consequence of this, they have made a similar plan to get Iran out from Lebanon. They got Saad Hariri to resign and declare that he has threat from Iran and Hezbollah.</p>\r\n<p>Then after this they will arouse the Christian and Sunni communities inside Lebanon due to which protests will start against Iran and Hezbollah inside Lebanon. The people of Lebanon will come out on street to defend their Prime Minister. Then after that UN will step inside to threaten Iran to come out of Lebanon, stop Hezbollah and if they don’t do then all nations should unitedly attack Iran; the way did for Syria before. This was one other step of his spider politics but he got disgraced. That disgrace happened as he got the Prime Minister of Lebanon to resign, made him issue a statement but the Sunnis and Christian of Lebanon cursed Saudi Arabia that you have insulted us by arresting our Prime Minister and telling that he has threat. There is no threat to him and if he has to resign he should first come back. Michel Aoun has also said and Sunnis as well have expressed hatred towards Saudi Arabia. The pictures of Mohammed bin Salman which were present in Sunni areas of Lebanon were burnt and they blamed Saudi Arabia was sparking off war with Lebanon. Saudi will try to bomb Lebanon for supporting Sunnis and make the state of Lebanon same as Yemen. He has prepared Israel to attack Hezbollah. Then Iran will step in there to help Hezbollah and then from here these Arabs, America, West will all siege Iran in Lebanon and beat Iran there. But this spider got caught in its own web and the Lebanese people have expressed their hatred towards Ale Saud. They made this policy that Hezbollah will become passionate. The government will come down, cabinet will dissolve and there will be panic in Lebanon. Hezbollah did the opposite; they ensured government remains as it is, they expressed sympathy towards Saad Hariri. They said he is our Prime Minster and he should be released. Michelle Aoun has said that if within two days Saad Hariri is not released I will put up a case against Saudi Arabia in United Nations. Whatever they decide became opposite. Now what they should do so they found a middle way that Saad Hariri will leave Saudi but not return to Lebanon instead he will go to France. They have released this news and it is possible that he will go to France and then they will somehow  try to confuse this matter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Establishment of alliance with Israel  </strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img10_1.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="210" />One more Spider politics they have done in Saudi Arabia is that the Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubair has written a formal letter to King Salman on behalf of Foreign Ministry that under the current situation we have only one way that is to establish formal relationship with Israel. The country that can give us salvation is the government of Israel and no one else can come to our help. His intention was that from Iran no one can give us salvation other than Israel. Yesterday the commander in chief of Israeli forces has given an interview to newspaper that since Saudi and Israel have common interests hence the time has come that both nations should join hands and make united force to confront Iran. Israel has become the most wild and fearful beast after the defeat of ISIS in Syria. I have said this before as well that the war in Syria is decisive. The one who win this battle that party will become decisive and effective in Middle East. That decision has been almost done, ISIS has been defeated in both Syria and Iraq. The battle has been won by Syria, Iraq, Hezbollah and Russia. The way the world war took place it was won by opposition of Germany that is France, Britain and their allies. They divided Germany later and many restrictions were imposed on Germany. Germany cannot make their force, they cannot make atomic powers though some of them Germany has resolved. The role which Germany has to play in UN they should get. In the region the decisive politics is of one who wins.      </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Attempts to diplomatically besiege Iran</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img11_1.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="375" /></p>\r\n<p>Mohammed bin Salman is raising the issue of Yemen a lot that Iran is interfering in Yemen and the missile attacks done from Yemen is done by Iran. This missile has created a big fear on Saudi Arabia. They have seen this and experienced in Syria that they beat very brutally. Hence neither Israel nor Saudi Arabia will try to fight the same way again but one atmosphere they are creating is to unite global countries, pass resolutions to control Iran from interfering in Arab countries. The noise that is going on is this and Mohammed bin Salman is trying his tactics now. At the same time he has taken foolish steps inside the country, he has done rebellion inside the family, he is changing the state of government, he is attacking Yemen, getting in confrontation with Iran and now this Spiderman has been told that you will be the record breaking emperor in Saudi history. In Saudi the emperorship comes at the age of 80 and then the king dies at 85 years. The time for rulership is only limited. He has been told that he is the first prince who will become ruler in young age and then he will rule for more than 60 years and will be the world record of longest emperorship. At present the record of longest rulership is of Queen Elizabeth who is in power since sixty years and his son has reached the age of seventy years but she is not dying. They are now saying that she will give up the position but she is fit. Mohammed bin Salman wants to break this record. </p>\r\n<p><strong> 9. Reversal from Orthodox Islamic laws to Liberalism </strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img12.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="203" />One more step he has taken is a reversal of many laws. Like he has declared the holiday for Eid Milad Nabi which was considered as prohibited to celebrate in Saudi Arabia. They considered celebrating the birth anniversary of personalities as a big sin but he has announced that on 12th Rabi ul Awwal will be nation holiday. He has announced that this country will be Liberal. He has given permission for women to visit sports stadium. There will be teams of women.  On one side he is transforming family rulership to himself and on other hand he is making the government as liberal so that Western support remains with him. He is doing everthing with a foolishness. He has arrested effective persons from inside the country into prison. He is breaking all the orthodox customs in the country. He is fueling fire against Iran. He has created this kind of atmosphere getting Middle East into a state of uncertainty. It is evident that when such foolish steps are taken these are signs that the time for eradication of this accursed family has come. Allah will give salvation to the entire Muslim Ummah from this accursed family soon.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132451241512058797new3_-_Copy.jpg', '', '1511516911Salman_Spiderman.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2017-12-14 10:52:04', 'Y'),

It is not that Iran wants to become an atomic power and they do not want Iran to become an atomic power. The way the Supreme Leader has said that the actual battle is not an atomic war instead it is an ideological war; a battle between revolution and the enemies of Islamic revolution. The actual war is between arrogant, imperialistic powers and the Islamic system of Imamate and Ummat, which is Wilayat-e-Faqeeh.<br /> It is a historic fact that America gave this suggestion and started this act of turning Iran into an atomic power at the time of Shah’s Regime. The first atomic power plant was given by a German company to Iran on the instructions of America which is now being constructed by a Russian company in Bushehr and some parts of it have already become active. It was America’s planning to turn Iran into a nuclear power thus this is not the actual issue; the real issue is with the Islamic governance system in Iran which is confronting the system of these Taghoots (deviant devilish powers). The system of Imamate or Wilayat does not compromise with Taghoots, and this was the reason that immediately after the Islamic revolution, America wrapped up the socialistic systems and closed that front, because they realized that socialism is not their actual enemy. They realized that their real enemy is not socialism, instead the power that can destroy their arrogant, tyrannical regimes is the Ideology of divine Quranic Islamic system whose leadership is in the hands of Shiite. They witnessed this and after closing all other fronts they turned towards Middle East and specifically towards the Islamic system.<br /> They aroused Saddam and Saddam started the war with the same justification for which the negotiations have been done today. After this eight year war with Saddam they did not stop, and turned towards creating several seditions (Fitnah) inside the Islamic republic. In 2009 a very severe crisis was created against the Islamic system in which government elements were involved, and there were three persons who were openly declared in Iran as the Chiefs of this Fitnah, and there was a fourth person also who was referred to as the supporter of these three. Who are these four people? Two of them are under house arrest now; one is Mahdi <img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/2.png" alt="" width="300" height="234" />Karroubi who had been the head of parliament for five years became a chieftain of this Fitnah. Mir Hossein Mousavi who was the prime minister for eight years was another chief of this Fitnah. Mohammad Khatami who was the president of the country for eight years and around sixteen years he was the minister also; all these were the chieftains of the Fitnah in 2009. The fourth person who is considered as the supporter of this Fitnah; Hashmi Rafsanjani was the guardian for these three. This devastating sedition was like an earthquake against the system of Wilayat in 2009, and shook the pillars from inside. The war of Saddam was nothing as compared to this Sedition but the way Allah protected this revolution from the war and many other threats; Allah protected this system also from this potentially devastating sedition. The means which were used by Allah to protect the revolution from this Fitnah was the deep insight (Baseerat) of the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei) which protected the system, revolution and everything of this nation.<br /> I am mentioning all this to highlight the fact that there is a continuous encounter and confrontation with the Islamic System. In this Fitnah Saudi Arabia played a very important role. There was a book which we published by the name of “Defeated Velvet Revolution in Iran” in which complete details about this Fitnah were discussed and this book was distributed across the globe.<br /> <img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/3.png" alt="" width="330" height="208" />This atomic diplomacy battle is the continuation of the same Fitnah. They made an excuse that Iran has turned into an atomic power and is making a nuclear bomb which is a threat to Israel. This is a fact also that a nation which explicitly says in their strategy that Israel should be eradicated, then definitely Israel has a threat from Iran. If such a nation becomes an atomic power then all their efforts go to waste. Obama has also said this clearly that we will do everything possible to protect Israel from any threats, and we will not refrain from destroying an Islamic nation if it becomes a threat to Israel; at any cost we are committed to the protection and existence of Israel. They have made this nuclear thing an issue to once again give a blow to the Islamic system and by this issue they want to disturb the internal circumstances in Iran.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Economic Sanctions – Most effective weapon</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most effective weapon till date which the enemies of Islamic revolution have adopted is the weapon of economic sanctions. This has proved as a big blow to the national economy of Iran; currency fell down significantly, inflation went up, and it disturbed the lives of people significantly inside Iran. Since the time the sanctions started around twelve years ago, restrictions kept on increasing and despite of being under these tight sanctions the Islamic system not only ran the nation, but continued with the progress and development of the country. You can visit Iran every year, and see every year how much development is happening in a country which is choked with continuous severe sanctions.<br /> <img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/4.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" />At the same time they continued with negotiations also, and the current President Agha Hassan Rouhani was the chief diplomat of the Atomic file at that time during the Presidency of Khatami. Rouhani was the chief of National Security Council and he was visiting Geneva, Vienna and other places as a senior diplomat for negotiations and dialogues. Rouhani supervised these negotiations for eight years, and without the instructions or directions for USA or UN they voluntarily suspended their nuclear project. In order to express their good will on the instructions of Khatami, and diplomacy of Rouhani they suspended the nuclear projects. They locked all their nuclear plants and even applied restrictions in universities for imparting nuclear education in order to gain confidence of America. The one sided suspension continued for eight years under the presidency of Khatami but no sanctions were eased out instead more restrictions were imposed despite of this voluntary step taken by Khatami.<br /> Then the new president Ahmadinejad came in and decided that despite of suspending the nuclear activities still you are imposing strict sanctions on us then why should not we continue with our nuclear development. He reinstated the nuclear project, accelerated it and took the development to an astonishing level. He achieved success in many segments which the enemies could not believe. The machinery which is required for Uranium enrichment was a very basic one present in Iran which was then indigenously enhanced and they produced thousands of other pieces of advanced machinery. The enemies now realized that Iran has got the nuclear technology, and Iran has also spread the nuclear development project across the country in many secure places.<br /> The USA kept on tightening the sanctions and literally disconnected Iran from the entire world. One of the effects that came on Pakistan was the Iran Gas pipeline which Iran developed and brought it to the border of Pakistan but Pakistan is not taking it because of sanctions on Iran.<br /> These sanctions bring pressure on people and there are internal elements who harmonize with the enemies. The internal elements give signals to the external entities to increase restrictions and at the same time they arouse the people internally that these restrictions are due to our atomic project enhancements. They try to present to people that we do not have bread, our kitchens are getting closed and nation is going after nuclear enrichment. As a result of this the effects of sanctions started to manifest themselves. The internal hypocrites and external enemies joined hands to aggravate the effects of sanctions thereby creating a crisis inside the country; besieging Wilayat whose effects are clearly visible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Negotiations – A diplomatic warfare</strong></p>\r\n<p>These sanctions and this crisis is breaking the back of the nation. It is the obligatory duty of the leadership to get the people out of this crisis, protect the nation and thus once again the Supreme Leader presented a plan which was termed as “Narmish-e- Ghahrmanane” (Heroic flexibility). This is the terminology used by the Leader which actually comes out from the translation of a book which the leader did at the time of revolution. This book was from Syed Razi on the subject of Peace treaty of Imam Hassan (a.s). The content of the book which the leader presented was that Imam Hassan (a.s) demonstrated a heroic flexibility with the peace treaty he did with Muaviya. I have already explained this before as to why Imam Hassan (a.s) did this because He (a.s) himself says; that my enemies and my companions together have made several dangerous plans and in order to counter those I have adopted this strategy of heroic flexibility (refer to strategy chart at the end of the article)</p>\r\n<p> <img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/5.png" alt="" width="238" height="135" />When the new government of Rouhani came into power and they again aggressively started the negotiations; the Leader used this terminology of Heroic flexibility indicating that we want to get the nation out of this crisis. He gave the opportunity to the government to negotiate and this was a diplomatic battle which was being fought on the table. This battle is tougher than the war of weapons because this battle needs intelligence, wisdom, cleverness, awareness, courage, perseverance and stamina is required, and this battle went on for twelve years.</p>\r\n<p>It is clear that on one side enemy has dangerous conspiracy and internally there are elements who are supporting the enemy, and together both of them aiming to destroy the system of Wilayat. They were building pressure on the system of Wilayat through the people. The plots of both internal and external enemies were defeated by these negotiations which were done under closed monitoring by the Leader who drew certain red lines which could not be crossed at all. These negotiations are an example for the entire world and specifically for Pakistan. The battles which were fought in the world eventually became the syllabus of the courses and are taught in military schools; like the Iran Iraq war is being taught to all armies of the world right now. They teach them about the techniques used in these wars and they become part of the Military academy curriculum. Similarly these negotiations should also become part of the curriculum and Pakistani ministers should study on how diplomatic warfare is done. I have said this earlier also that two phone calls have become historic in Pakistan; one call was a three minute call from the foreign minister of USA to General Parvez Musharraf at the time of Afghanistan attack by USA, whereby he was told to either join them or be ready for destruction and this General immediately submitted. The USA foreign minister later wrote in his book that the president of Pakistan did not even asked time from me; he immediately submitted to our demand. The second call which came just a few days earlier after the Pakistan security agencies caught an NGO by the name “Save the Children” which was involved in anti-national activities. The Interior minister declared that certain outside nations, including America and Israel are supporting this NGO, and so this NGO was sealed. On the very next day a call came from USA to the Prime Minister to again reopen the NGO and they did it.</p>\r\n<p>Here you can see that they submit on one phone call whereas this nation of Iran has been negotiating since twelve years that too against six top most devilish powers. The two worst devilish powers amongst these five are China and Russia who took the benefits from both sides in these negotiations. They told America to accept their certain demands else they will side with Iran; on the other hand they seeked demands from Iran with the threat that they will side with the USA. These two countries acted as traders and not politicians in these negotiations; they earned a lot and will earn more. You should be aware that these six nations are devilish, goons, rowdies and worst nations of the world, who are confronting and are on the opposite side of that nation who is holding the standard of Islam in their hand.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Joint declaration – Supporters and Opponents</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/6.png" alt="" width="250" height="142" />This is a historic point that they fought for twelve years and this battle has not yet ended. The battle is ongoing and what they have issued is a joint declaration. Now everyone is talking about this joint declaration and on both sides there are supporters as well as opponents of this declaration. In USA also there are supporters and opponents; even in the camp of Obama; Hilary Clinton who is the potential candidate for next USA presidency is in strict opposition to this agreement. She is the successor of Obama and is from his party. Then the other opposition is the Republican Party which is the party of Bush who are in Congress, and are strictly opposing this agreement because of the effectiveness of Zionism on them. Israel and Saudi Arabia are the biggest opponents of this joint declaration. In Iran also there are supporters and opponents of this declaration with both giving their own reasons.<br /> This is ongoing and it is not that everything has ended. The statements which are issued in public are different and what is signed behind closed doors is something different. In the upcoming days Congress has to review this agreement at the same time in Iran also it has been announced that the Iranian parliament will review every point of this Joint declaration and if it is found in national interest only then they will accept. It is not that whether this will happen or not happen; it will happen as well as will not happen continuously because this is part of a battle which will continue the same way as it was before.<br /> These devilish powers will not lift the sanctions because after a long time they have got such an effective weapon in their hand. Saddam martyred three thousand youths of Iran but this did not shake Iran. The graveyards are full, several families got martyred but Iran did not feel the pressure but with these sanctions they have felt the pressure and back is breaking down; and they also realized that they need to straighten their back. The enemies realized that we tried military power, other forces but we could not break Iran but these sanctions have been effective and it is natural that they will not waste this weapon of theirs and will keep on playing with them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Wali-e-Faqeeh – The Supreme Authority</strong></p>\r\n<p> It is really a serious matter specifically for those across the world who are admirers and supporters of Islamic revolution. You should know that in Iran the Supreme Authority is the Leader (Wali-e-Faqeeh), and without the permission of the Leader things cannot move in Iran. They create plans to besiege the leader and carry out these mischiefs of getting the leader in confrontation with masses but with all praise to Allah the Leader has always defeated their conspiracies. Whenever they have worked out any stratagems, Allah’s stratagem has always disgusted and disgraced them.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/7.png" alt="" width="175" height="255" />As said earlier the ex-president Mohammad Khatami has been the chieftain of these seditions and Iranian court has officially announced that publishing the picture of Khatami anywhere is prohibited. He is a criminal who created this sedition in 2009. Thus it is possible that certain governmental elements, bureaucrats can do some mischiefs but these are not supreme authorities. Parliament or President are not supreme authorities because the system in Iran is not democracy it is the system of Wilayat. The supreme power is Wali-e-Faqeeh who comprehends all the matters and will not allow their mischiefs to be successful. Hence all the well-wishers, supporters and lovers of Islamic revolution should remain relaxed that this difficulty would not come in place. It is clear that these sanctions have been very effective and they have built a lot of pressure on the people and it is the duty of the leader to bring the nation out of such crisis. One way is diplomacy which will go on, and this battle play will keep on going but they will reap other secondary benefits from this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Benefits of Joint declaration to Obama and Rouhani</strong></p>\r\n<p> In Iran the parliament elections are about to take place in this year. At present the parliament is under the opposition majority, which international media terms as conservative traditionalist and in Iran they call them Principle-ists and they are not in harmony with the existing president. Mr. Rouhani wants the parliament to have his majority. Khatami and Rafsanjani want a clean sweep in the next election thus having their own candidates in these elections. This way parliament will come under their control and then they can do whatever they want. Thus the major effect of this agreement inside Iran will be on the upcoming parliamentary elections because this government has given a lot of statements that the issue is resolved and sanctions have been removed but in reality nothing has happened. There is not even a single sanction that has been lifted. This is just an announcement and after six months it can reactivate itself, they will say that Iran is not doing what we have asked for. They would say that we wanted to close down so and so thing but they did not do it, and again this issue will restart. Iran government will say we are doing what you are saying and P5+1 will deny through their teeth and issue will drag on. The thing which will happen irrespective of sanctions being removed or not is the effect on elections which are about to take place in both USA and parliamentary elections in Iran. The Iranian side wants to make use of this for the Parliamentary election, hence they are giving excited statements about celebrations for this success, whereas America is saying we do not trust Iranians and Supreme Leader has said we have no trust on Americans.</p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/8.png" alt="" width="270" height="146" />In such an environment it is a battle which was going on and also in future it will continue. This agreement declaration has internal benefits for both sides; whereby Obama wants to win the election for his party and he is saying also that I have protected the world from a big danger and destruction by doing this agreement with Iran. He is convincing the Americans that Iran was about to destroy the world and I have saved it, whereas Mr. Rouhani is convincing his people that Iranians were about to die of starvation and I have saved them. Obama is saying I have protected the world and Mr. Rouhani says I have protected Iran so that both can win the elections. This is the reason for which they have triggered this issue and media being one sided is not presenting the facts. The columnists are writing baseless things that now “Death to America” slogans will end and both will be good friends. A youth during a recent gathering of students with the Supreme Leader in the month of Ramadan asked the leader that if this agreement goes through will we still say “Death to America” or not? The Leader replied that the battle will go on with arrogance, Taghoot and “Death to America” will be said until Qayamat.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Effect of this declaration on Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/9.png" alt="" width="276" height="162" />One part of this agreement is associated with Pakistan and our ministers have started to quote that now Gas will come soon but the fact is that it will not come because first America has stopped it and now Saudi Arab will stop it. First America has said that due to sanctions on Iran you cannot take this gas from Iran, and now Saudi Arab will tell Pakistan that after taking so much money from us you are taking gas from Iran? Wiki Leaks has recently released a new version related to Saudi Arabian secrets which are present on Internet in which there is a lot related to Pakistan because Saudi Arab has high interference in Pakistan. Saudi Arab has even gone to India to stop them from taking oil from Iran but India has said that our refinery system is designed for Iranian oil because there are various types of oil. India said that we cannot take oil from any other country since our refineries cannot support it. Saudi Arab replied that we will deploy a new refinery free for Saudi oil and you should not take oil from Iran. One more announcement which Wiki Leaks has done is about few years back one Pakistani university invited Iranian Ambassador in one of their conventions. Saudi Arab came and suspended the Vice Chancellor of the university. Saudi Arab has this much interference in Pakistan, and no news are given about them in Media so how can they allow Pakistan to take gas from Iran? The slavery which Pakistan is doing with Saudi Arab is much worst then the slavery of America. This slavery of King Salman, Bedouins and these Arab terrorists has become a destiny of Pakistan and we pray to Allah to give salvation to Pakistan and everyone else from these beasts.</p>\r\n<p> </p>', 'N', 'N', '15132451881512058825new1_-_Copy.jpg', '', '1512570584Deal_or_No_Deal.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2017-12-14 10:53:08', 'Y');

Last week some bitter incidents took place which were grievous whereby three believers were martyred by terrorists in D.I. Khan and then in order to stop this the Pakistan army carried out an operation and in that operation a Pakistani army Major was killed. To this extent is Pakistan insecure and this entire nation is insecure for believers to the extent that even the Pakistani forces are not secure that an Army Major gets killed by the terrorists. Similarly one martyrdom took place in Karachi. We pray for the forgiveness of these martyrs and we seek patience from Allah for the family of these deceased.</p>\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image1.png" alt="" width="277" height="165" />The second incident which is under process in Pakistan is the protest in Islamabad by one group. This is a unique thing of sit in protests that has started in Pakistan. It has been almost 17 to 18 days whereby the protestors are sitting on the Islamabad and Rawalpindi Junction and have blocked the motorway. The government has become helpless in front of them. The sit in protest is about a matter whereby few weeks before some alterations were done in the Election candidates form document related to the Seal of Prophethood (Khatme Nabuwat). Some ministry or authority made a new bill for every new election. In the past it was written that I swear and now it was changed to I confess. On this matter issue was made that with this change a conspiracy has been done whereby it was claimed that the Seal of Prophethood has come under threat and movements started to secure that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Parliament accepted the mistake and rectified it to the original statement but still this protest is ongoing. They are asking to bring out the criminals, victims, punish them and hand them over to them. This is known as non-issue and without any reason a crisis is being created and this face has been given. In reality the atmosphere that has been created in Pakistan and the elements, groups that have been formed in Pakistan this is all going to happen and will remain. Those who are thinking that this will change are simple minded because the way this has all changed its face the effects of this will be like this only. Since there are only few months left for the election coming up next year. The government has been a victim of crisis already; the Prime Minister has been suspended and declared as ineligible. The government is under pressure and the ground is being prepared for the next election. The political parties are making alliances for the elections. MMA (Muttahida Majlis e Amal) is again trying to revive itself. Certain religious groups which are highly extremist, prejudicial have made alliances with secular groups. The extremists have done alliance with secular groups. The party with which Jamaat e Islami had done alliance in last election now an extremist has taken the place of Jamaat e Islami to do alliance with the secular group. Sami ul Haqq group who are the hosts, supporters, guardians of extremism and are known as father of Taliban, Mujahideen and they have done alliance with Tahreek-e-Insaaf. In such situations at the time of elections both secularism as well as religious extremism become dubious</p>\n<p>MMA was made at the time of Parvez Musharraf and they established government as well in border areas. They were Parvez Musharraf&rsquo;s strengthening group and were known as the B team of Parvez Musharraf.&nbsp; Parvez Musharraf became the President by one vote and that was given by them. On the outward they were in opposition but inside they were his companions and for the sake of power they were willing to do everything. The only difference between secular and religious groups is about tool. One has secularism as a tool with them and other has religion as a tool. Neither they are secular nor they are religious and they both don&rsquo;t have faith on their schools. They both have faith only on power, personal gains, wealth, positions, posts and these things. They have faith only to get power whether it comes from fighting with each other or support each other whichever way. This is the political formula of Pakistan that in order to gain power everything is permissible. You can make sacredness also as a tool, means and with secularism you can make even non sanctitous things as means like nationalism, masses or religion</p>\n<p>At present there is anxiety on this sit in protest because this is an unacceptable phenomenon which people are trying to understand as to what will come out with this phenomenon. This group that is doing protests in Islamabad and plan to spread across Pakistan are Barelvi Ahle Sunnah. Ahmad Raza is the follower of Barelvi sect. In Pakistan a major categorization if we do in Ahle Sunnah then there are four major Sunni sects. One are the Barelvi Sunnis who believe in celebrating the Birth Anniversary of Prophet, recited eulogies, going to shrines, graves of Saints etc. Against them are Deobandi who consider all these acts of remembering Prophets and certain elderly personalities as forbidden. The third group is Ahle Hadith who are mostly Salafi. In Deobandi also there are various branches like political, extremist and seminaries. Then the fourth ones are Sufism and sages; though they have their own identity like Qadri, Chishti but are still closer to Barelvi; we can even say they are the same.</p>\n<p>At present those who are protesting against government and have stepped inside politics is the Barelvi group which is seen in Pakistan as a new Political power. Prior to this Deobandi Sunnis were in politics in full flow like the party of Fazalur Rehman; Jameatul Ulama e Islam whose guides are Sami ul Haqq. Ahle Hadith were also involved in politics before but Barelvi prior to this were not participating in politics this way. But now they have jumped into politics in a full fledge way. But their style, slogans, leadership, statements are highly dubious. They are sitting in the protests with sticks, batons; they have paralyzed two cities but Police is not having the courage to get them out. The government has this opinion that they have been made to sit intentionally, provoke the police and then police would force them to get up, then there will be conflicts between police and protestors; blood will spill and this blood would be used to create a wave of protests across the country and this way the 2018 elections will get insured from now itself as to who will win and lose. If the government shoots bullets on them then the party to which the current government belongs to will get highly condemned with the help of media and they will lose elections. This is the common view which they are giving and government, media are taking it in this perspective.</p>\n<p>The way of Sit in protests has become very common and every sect, group wants to use this method of sit in protests to get their stance accepted. The government, state rulership is a big power which can only be challenged with people&rsquo;s power which can paralyze the state. But the power stemming out from parties, groups, classes cannot stand for long. People can confront state but not the parties. But in Pakistan this has become a trend that you can try to get something accepted by the state with the sit in protests. The sit in protests are not done on the issues which are orally proclaimed instead behind the scene issues are something else. The actual issue between the protestors and the opponent against whom protests are done is somewhere else. In order to keep the opposition under pressure for that issue this politics of sit in protests is done. Since in these protests; parties, groups, organizations get involved and it can even reach a dangerous level which has happened in the past on several occasions. We can even say that this can even end up into a form of civil war specifically with the political instability prevailing in the state and this can impact every street in the country. An Internal civil war is a very bad war whereby the people get divided into groups and they fight, kill each other in every street and home. Such type of protests and reactionary actions can lead into that direction and its end cannot be predictive. Those who use these protests as a mean for their political interests are doing foolishness and in this protest politics is not at all in favor of nation. They want to give no importance to other nation, laws, constitution and just want to sit in for protests and get their stand accepted. If the issue is related to constitution then resolve it through law and court. Anyway these are all preparations for elections and its effects are coming on everything and if this adopts an extremist form then severe affects would be seen on ordinary people and will become the basis of more difficulties for Pakistan.</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Mugabe &ndash; Icon of Anti Imperialism </strong></p>\n<p>One more important incident that took place last week was in Zimbabwe. As such we Pakistani only know Zimbabwe in context of Cricket team but don&rsquo;t know where that country is. Zimbabwe is in the southern part of Africa and is in the neighbor of South Africa (the last southern edge country of Africa). Since last few weeks Zimbabwe is in the news headlines. The reason behind is that the Zimbabwe President; Robert Mugabe who is the ruler of Zimbabwe since forty years and has won the election seventh time to come into power got ousted from Presidency. His personality, politics is unique in entire Africa. Robert Mugabe has been made to resign at the age of ninety three years from Presidency due to a military coup against him. Due this coup he has been forced to leave the rulership at the age of ninety three. This person is an icon of anti-imperialism movement in Africa. He has played a significant role in the movement to get freedom for Zimbabwe from Britain and then also in the politics of Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image2.png" alt="" width="231" height="218" />Certain parts of Africa are rich and some parts are poor but the Africa towards the South which is surrounded by water from three sides is a rich area. It has oil, gas and mines of minerals, gold and diamonds. The lands are highly fertile, beautiful place and cultivated. In this part of Africa there is a big population of white skinned persons though Africa is dominated by Blacks. The white skins over here means Western people and not just British. All persons with white skins are not English. These white skins persons in big numbers have settled in Africa. When West became insecure with Hitler starting war and entire Europe was almost ruined then at the time when these people were starving and in pursuit of security they migrated to South Africa. Their numbers increased and they started to rule over the locals there. They made an atmosphere of racism which was then confronted by the movement of Nelson Mandela who finished the government of whites and made a united or black government. Nelson Mandela is an icon aginst racism, communism in Africa but he is not an opponent of Imperialism.</p>\n<p>Robert Mugabe is a communal person and he keeps the foundation on African communism. He is against the white skinned, Britain, America and Imperialism. Robert Mugabe is that person who had a vision about the downtrodden and backwardness of Africa. Africa which is rich, fertile land but most of the people live under poverty, oppression and are deprived of basic necessities of life. I also got the opportunity to see one or two places in Africa also though they were not that poor but certain nations in Africa are highly downtrodden. Robert Mugabe believes the cause for all the backwardness, lowliness of African is due to Western People and it is true. All the wealth that is present in Africa is looted by West. France is deeply involved in many African countries and still certain countries of Africa are completely under France even now. Similarly certain areas are under Britain, Italy and above all these is America. The locals are their slaves and still the worst form of slavery is in Africa. These mines whose wealth is being looted by the West has all locals as labors.</p>\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image3.png" alt="" width="257" height="169" />In the neighborhood of Zimbabwe are Namibia, Zambia, Botswana who are all rich and they have highly valuable mines. The whites and even Arabs specifically Lebanese are settled there. Robert Mugabe freedom for his country from these people of West and then after that he got the lands also out from them. All the lands, farms, mines which were captured by West he took from them and gave it to Blacks. This way Mugabe become an icon of resistance against white skinned persons globally. The Western world together boycotted Zimbabwe in a cruel manner. Their currency is the most invaluable in the world. This way they destroyed them and despite of this this person remained firm against them. He got elected as the President seven times and around two times he was the Prime Minister. They have besieged him since long and there was high pressure on Mugabe and they wanted to end him because he has become an example for other African nations, who might get impressed with him and tread in the same direction of confronting Western interests in the region.</p>\n<p>Hence with pressure running over half a century they have pursued him to resign under a military coup. As such he is ninety three and a person of this age as such is not capable of running a government. At this stage for most of the people organs fail, they are not able either listen, see but this person is a wonder that at ninety three years he is running a government and eventually they had to remove him with the help of forces. Though there was no bloodshed but he was removed under a military coup. Mugabe will forever remain an icon in Africa. Mandela got more protocols because he was not Anti Imperialism; he was only an opponent of racism. He was not in opposition of West and more than African the West has given him more importance but Mugabe is hated by West. The West say that Mugabe is a devil. This was a very important incident that took place but the media has not taken this matter the way it deserved because the media is also slave. Hence it makes no difference for them if an icon of resistance falls down. They become happy on this. The way the President of Cuba, Fidel Castro was also an icon against Imperialism; Mugabe is also a similar icon. Such kind of personalities are not liked by West. Mugabe ideologically was a communist, socialist but a supporter of African community.</p>\n<p><strong>Downfall of Ale Saud Royal family</strong></p>\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image4.png" alt="" width="259" height="191" />One more important news hitting the headlines daily is the downfall of Saudi Royal family. This insane, foolish Mohammad bin Salman who is dreaming about become an emperor of modern Saudi Arabia arrested several members of Saudi Royal family and punished them. It was there in the news today that he hanged them upside down inside the hotel in which he had besieged them. There were more than five hundred most effective persons from Royal family related to trade, business, and army, politics who were arrested and put inside jail. It was there in news that he has called American private Security force Black Water. Black water has been involved in Yemen; Iraq and for some time they were present in Pakistan as well. They are a more dreadful agency then ISIS whereby disgraced criminals are taken, trained and their attires, make ups are made dreadful and like a Hollywood film they carry out operations. Mohammad bin Salman has taken the services of Blackwater for torturing the princes who he arrested. They as a first step have made the Princes hang upside down in Hotel and this is the beginning and God willing very soon Mohammad bin Salman will also be hanging upside down in the same place. This is the beginning of the end of this accursed family which has started from inside. The way I said last week that all the Spider politics which he made have all failed. Both Trump and Mohammad bin Salman are haunted by Iran. They don&rsquo;t talk about anything else other than Iran. They even scare their wives from Iran and their people, Arab world and the entire world that Iran is very dangerous. Bin Salman like a film cartoon has stepped in the ground who gets disgraced. You would have seen a cartoon by the name Pink Panther. Though that animal is very powerful but in that cartoon it is shown as very timid, weak and disgraced. This is a pink colored Leopard but most of the times get beaten by mouse, cat, fly and always gets humiliated.&nbsp; Bin Salman is a similar Pink Panther.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Arab NATO which he has made has a conference few days from now. He has started military drills along with Pakistan and this is the preparation he is doing against Iran. He has made this Arab NATO in which only few countries have practically got involved and rest all he has paid money and kept them under alliance. He is trying to take all steps aginst Iran.</p>\n<p>One step he has taken against Iran is in Lebanon. Since Lebanon is a strong base of Iran and hence in order to bash Iran in Lebanon through Israel he played this conspiracy. He made Saad Hariri to resign so that a crisis gets created in Lebanon and protests would start in Lebanon, which will be confronted by Hezbollah, Iran and then Israel will step inside and deal with Iran. But all this went against him and Saad Hariri himself has now gone against them. He has taken back his resignation and has met the Lebanese President. This card of bin Salman failed. He went after Qatar to isolate it; but it became more strong and closer to Iran though it has been always against Iran. He broke the Arab league also and now Oman., Qatar are openly against him. He called a gathering of Arab league and only the nominees of Bahrain, Saudi Araba yelled on Iran and rest nothing happened. Whatever step he took went against him and got disgraced. Now he is calling a conference on 26<sup>th</sup> for the Arab NATO in which Defense representatives of these nations will participate to make a war policy. These are his step which the entire world is attentive towards and are a sign that this family will get wiped off soon. People are now waiting for reactions from inside Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabi extremists, member of Royal family are all present in Saudi Arabia and the entire atmosphere of Saudi Arabia is under state of shock.</p>\n<p>There is a question as to why no reaction has been seen till now? Neither the religious group spoke out, nor anyone from royal family, nor people or any other group. The Media is giving this impression that this silence is because of acceptance of Mohammad bin Salman by everyone. Media is telling that people are happy that this person has come for growth and prosperity of Saudi Arabia. This is not true. The reason is that Saudi Arabia and similar states are rental states which gives compensations to their people for reaming silent. They have made their people useless. There is no leader, opposition and nothing other than Royal family. Even the Royal family did not expect that a day will come when they will be hanged upside down. There are countries in which there are groups, oppositions which show immediate reaction if something happens from state. But in Saudi they were never prepared for this. Now they have started to think and do preparations and it takes time in such nations where there is no leader, opposition, media and no freedom. It takes time for different powers to ally and show reactions. There will be definite reactions from inside and outside Saudi also the foolishness which he is doing might end him before time.</p>\n<p>Iran has as such openly said that we don&rsquo;t want this battle with Ale Saudi on any land. This is a wise politics that this war should not take place as it is highly destructive. But a time comes when war is imposed the way Saddam imposed then it has to be fought. It is certain that the first day of this war would be the last day for Ale Saud. This is amongst established fact. We can see the war ability of Ale Saud from Yemen. They are fighting in Yemen with supersonic warfare and in Yemen the weakest people are there and in these years they could not even capture an inch from Yemen though they have ruined Yemen and in fact Yemenis have gone inside Saudi. Now the Yemenis are launching missiles inside Saudi. Hence when you cannot fight with the poorest people of Yemen living in deserts, barefoot then you are getting into a confrontation with such a powerful nation which has all war machinery. It is just a matter of yesterday that they have bashed you brutally in Iraq and Syria. They have rubbed your nose on ground and you are planning to fight with them? This is a foolishness and this happens when someone is in rush for his own destruction. God willing Allah will give salvation to all Muslims from their evils.</p>\n<p><strong>End of ISIS occupancy in Syria and Iraq</strong></p>\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image5.png" alt="" width="255" height="191" />The most important news that flashed out last week was the complete end of ISIS occupancy in both Syria and Iraq. It is not the end of ISIS but the areas on which ISIS had occupancy in Syria and Iraq has ended. The last area in Syria which was under ISIS control has also been taken back. ISIS is still there and some people got this misunderstanding that ISIS has been finished. ISIS is there but their occupation has ended. There is no area on Iraqi land which is under ISIS control. In Pakistan also ISIS is present almost everywhere like Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, KPK but hidden and they will carry out guerilla operations. First what they did was that they occupied a big area of Syria and Iraq this occupation has been ended. ISIS is there but weak and does not possess that power which they had before. There were several reason behind their weakening. One reason was Russia coming in opposition to them; second reason was Turkey getting away from them. Turkey did a foolishness and they had a disgraceful role in formation of ISIS. When turkey saw its internal situation worsening, they even did a foolishness of bringing down Russian warplane then they had to forcibly repent and from the time Turkey stopped supporting ISIS they started to become weak. And the final stroke which ISIS got was from Hezbollah, Iran and those defenders of Haram, those martyrs. May Allah bless these martyrs, grant patience to their families who did this great work that they purified two nations from the filthy ISIS existence.</p>\n<p>They are still remaining in a weak form and most of their fighters are killed. The policy of Hezbollah and those confronting ISIS did not had the policy of arresting them; instead their policy was to kill them. A big number amongst them have been killed, some escaped specifically from West; the Arab ISIS are still remaining and they are being moved to Afghanistan to take advantage from them in future. The second aspect of this is that it was not just ISIS which was present in Syria; there were other groups as well there who are still present and they still have some areas under their control. One such group is Jibhat ul Nusra , the Nusra Front which is a pure Takfirist group made by Saudi Arabia and supported by America. Then there is Syrian Liberation Army which is supported by America and they also have big areas under their control. Similarly there is a Kurd liberation army who are also supported by America and they also have a big area under their control. We have got freedom from ISIS occupancy but the other groups are still present. These other groups in majority are local Syrians. What happened now was decisive and Syrian army, Hezbollah, Iran have come under dominance and decisive position in Syria. It is possible that there might not be a war with other groups but negotiations. It is possible that they might be involved in government or something given to them.</p>\n<p>At present complete freedom of Syria has not yet been achieved but ISIS has been ended. This is a big thing done by these crusaders, the leader who have saved the entire world from this big threat, the Sunnis, Shias have been protected. The war that would be decisive was the Syrian war and the one who wins this will dominate the entire Middle East region. At present the scale of Iran, Hezbollah is heavy but as the Supreme Leader said that Satan will not remain negligent they will do the mischief somewhere else; the way Bin Salman is doing the preparations. It is possible he might open some another front in some other country. They cannot do in Syria but apart from that they can do this somewhere else like Bahrain, Yemen or start some operations in some parts of Iran as they have got a brutal stroke and badly wounded. A wounded snake is more dangerous.</p>\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image6.png" alt="" width="262" height="175" />Iran by eradicating ISIS has insulted, humiliated Trump and ninety countries from Arabs, West, East and everywhere. There were more than fifty countries personnel in ISIS and other nations were supporting them, providing them means and even a country like Japan has given them war vehicles. Korea, Japan have all provided means to ISIS for trade purpose as they have nothing to do with the Ideology. The Japanese Minister was asked how come so many Japanese vehicles were seen with ISIS and they replied that we are not able to locate the reseller of these vehicles. This was a big stroke which Iran has given them. What has happened you can consider that along with an armed field war there is a psychological war as well and for this type of war this victory was decisive. The psychological war breaks the back and weakens the courage of all fronts. The moment the news of a defeat of this type comes the courage of the leaders, fighter, supporters, finances all break. When the candidate in election loses the election the supporters and voters break out except for Shia voters who are never lose courage and are always ready to vote because they consider defeat only as victory. This feeling is there everywhere when defeat is suffered then once again they start to gather forces with time. This is the grace of Allah that the way Allah has promised that Allah will give a small group success over big group has come true</p>\n<p align="center">كَمْ مِنْ فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۗ</p>\n<p>The believers should ascertain that this way Allah gives success to small group over big group. This has happened now in your era and you should at least now ascertain that the promises which Allah has given that he will give dominance to weak ones and small groups if they have faith on Allah&rsquo;s promise. Allah will support them and this is the beginning in the entire Islamic world. There are many claimants of fighting against terrorism but the most successful operation against Terrorism is this only whereby two countries that came under control of a dreadful terrorist group got freedom. How? Who got them freedom? Hashad us Shabi, Defenders of Haram did this. They were not regular army men instead just ordinary normal people who got up on the call of Leader and Marjaiyat; got freedom for their country. We should ascertain that the promise of Allah comes true in every era but the condition is that you should have faith on it. This can repeat on any land and this is the beginning of that promise which Allah has made for the entire land. Allah&rsquo;s promise is there for believers and the righteous servants that I will grant you Caliphate of this earth to you. God willing that day will come for sure and that nation will be fortunate who will prepare the grounds for it when the Savior will come who will end terrorism, Taghoot, arrogance, imperialism , tyranny, oppression from the entire globe and the standard of Wilayat will waive everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Week of Unity</strong></p>\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image7.png" alt="" width="315" height="189" />It is the month of Rabi ul Awwal which is an esteemed month of grandeur. This month is associated with the celebrations of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and our sixth Imam (a.s). This event has a sanctity across the world, where the beliefs are expressed and specifically the days from 12<sup>th</sup> RA to 17<sup>th</sup> RA is the week of unity. The entire Muslims Ummah should also spend these days in unity because the tactic of enemy is to create discord. These are the days when the believers and entire Muslim Ummah even if they just raise the slogan of Unity carries importance because the voice of unity against Taghoot has an importance and effect. They have the slogan of hatred, discord and it is the duty of believers to plant the seed of unity. Unity is not a political tactic but instead an order of Allah which has been forgotten by Ummah and to claim faith without this is not correct. The believers everywhere should arrange for gatherings and rallies for celebration. Here also there will be efforts made for celebrations where believers should come together and express their love, faith for the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). This nation of Iqbal should get enlightened with the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s), and the unity, brotherhood of the Ummah is the best gift which the Ummah can present to Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). All other things we do like eulogies etc. carry happiness for us but we should do at least one such thing that grants happiness to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) which will only happen through unity and brotherhood of Ummah. Any step that is taken in this direction will be more effective and praiseworthy as compared to praises for any poems, eulogies. The value of any step taken for the sake of unity is very high and will carry high rewards.</p>\n<p>We pray to Allah to grant vastness to the efforts of these crusaders who got freedom from ISIS and the actual crown goes to none other than the Supreme Leader of Islamic revolution Ayatullah Syed Ali Khamenei (r.a).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1512061353banner.jpg', NULL, '1512061353Fitrat_-_final_for_print.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-05 17:16:50', 'N'),

They said that they want to move this fight inside Iran. They struck a blow to Iran with the attack on Iranian Parliament and Imam Khomeini (r.a) mausoleum with a terrorist attack. This was a big blow they did and proved their infiltration on the Iranian system. Now as per their imagination and what media is portraying they have given another big blow now. First they were giving this impression that Iran&rsquo;s influence and infiltration has increased in Arab nations which they were not liking. Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon is where Iranian influence is much higher than anyone else. They have replied this to Iran by infiltrating a Shia leader in Iraq;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq1.png" alt="" width="160" height="108" />Moqtada Sadr who is a famous personality. Last week he visited Saudi Arabia and met the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman; and discussed the issue of Arab nationalism. Saudi has given him the message that we have to strengthen the foundations of Arab nationalism; since Iraq, Saudi are all Arabs we should unite and confront Iran. The pictures of this meeting were released and this was more successful attack then the first <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq2.png" alt="" width="200" height="113" />one. They are imagining that they have infiltrated inside a big group in Iraq and after this Saudi newspapers published one more news that one bigger Shia group they are&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking&nbsp;&nbsp; out&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; Iranian alliance<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq3.png" alt="" width="195" height="121" /> That group is of Ammar Hakeem, the nephew of Martyr Baqir Hakim who till now is leading the group of Iraq Supreme council. Ammar Hakeem has left the Supreme&nbsp; council and made his own national party and he has come under the slogan of Arabism and seems to be inclined to align with Saudi. This is there in news though he has not yet done the visit. As per their news and imagination they have infiltrated in a big way by breaking these groups from being Iran alliance. But in reality Moqtada Sadr has added to his deprivation more and has stamped his senselessness and lack of insight.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="Section2" style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<p>There was a time when three Marajae out of four in Iraq who are not Iraqi nationals were asked to leave Iraq after the regime of Saddam toppled. Ayatullah Sistani and other two Marajae were asked to leave Iraq by Sadr because you are not Arabs. They had a group at the time of Saddam,&nbsp; whereby his father was martyred by Saddam. His father for a long time compromised with Saddam which he said was for the security of Shias and then <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq4.png" alt="" width="100" height="145" />after some time went again in opposition to Saddam; then Saddam martyred him along with some of his sons. From that time a powerful group of Shias were known as Sadr group which is being led by Moqtada Sadr now. This group was very powerful, armed and took party in many internal tribal conflicts. They also confronted America for some time and keep on changing their tactics. Then he left and came to Iran and studied there for some time supporting Iranian views.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes he was saying I have kept myself out of politics. Hence such ups, downs and instability is there in him. But at present he is not capable of doing anything.</p>\r\n<div class="Section3" style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq5.png" alt="" width="155" height="99" />The plan which Imam Khomeini (r.a) presented in Iran which destroyed all conspiracies was construction of Baseej. Despite of government <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq6.png" alt="" width="200" height="117" />structure of armed forces present Imam (r.a) prepared a peoples force as Baseej. The Baseej are those ordinary people who are prepared to defend their nation. The Supreme leader did the same in Iraq after ISIS entered Iraq and created a people&rsquo;s force by the name Hashad us Shabi.&nbsp;A peoples force was created and from the day it came into existence; Moqtada Sadr and many other Iraqi leaders were against it and did not wanted them.<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq7.png" alt="" width="175" height="114" /> This force is under the Wali e Faqeeh and it was Hashad us Shabi who uprooted ISIS from Iraq. After Hashad these power hungry groups of the likes of Sadr got despaired and realize that we cannot do anything. This was a people&rsquo;s force, with the Leader (Rahbar) ready to come out in every field. They were afraid for this day that Iraq will go out of their hands and come under Wali e Faqeeh. This was the reason they used to say before that ISIS is better than Iran&rsquo;s infiltration in Iraq. ISIS would have been finished two years before but this thinking that if Hashad did this, then this means Iran and we prefer ISIS over Iran.</p>\r\n<p>Such ruined persons like Sadr now come in limelight to do such alliances. You should be well versed that we also have many ruined ones; we have ruined leaders, devastated organizations, parties all over in every street of Pakistan who possess nothing and Saudi is buying out such ruined entities. The way in the Arab world Syed Nasrallah from Hezbollah is with Iran; they are thinking that they have a done a similar attack and got a person of the same status with them. This is a foolish thinking whereby you have made alliance with a ruined person and he will just waste your money. Saudi can create dissension but it is impossible the Sadr will do anything.</p>\r\n<p>It is a shamefulness for Moqtada to do alliance with Mohammad bin Salman because Salman did not say I am just anti Iran, anti-Khamenei but instead he said Iran believes in the Zuhoor of Mahdaviat hence I want to destroy them. This is that family of Ale Saud who have made an army to destroy Karbala in the&nbsp; past. They attacked Karbala and ploughed over there, they had ruined these shrines even beyond what they did in Baqee.<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq8.png" alt="" width="190" height="158" /> Shia remember all this but these vultures of power who have desires to eat corpses become blind for power. In Pakistan also there are Shia Ulama who take stipends and salaries from Saudi Embassy. These vultures are there everywhere and by making them join&nbsp; you, publishing pictures globally you are portraying that you have hunted a big prey. But this person is ruined and you will not get anything. Today Iraq has the base of Imamat and maximum of signs of Imams are present in Iraq. If Shiite comes towards Imamat then Ahle Sunna will also come towards Imamat. This is because Sunnis also have Imamat in their vision but not implemented in the right form. If you read the books of Maulana Maudoodi you will see that the political foundations of Sunnis is also on Imamat , an Imam of Justice but the place where they fit is somewhere wrong. If Shiite adopts the right path then Sunnis will also follow but till now the direction in Iraq has turned towards Imamat. They are ready to accept all systems except Imamat.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="Section4" style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<p align="left">&nbsp;<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq9.png" alt="" width="175" height="103" />Now there is referendum about to happen in Kurdistan which is the 1/3<sup>rd</sup> population of Iraq and they want to separate it from Iraq. Now also they have a separate Kurdish Iqlim governance. If in Iraq 1/3<sup>rd</sup> population of Kurd can establish their own governance then why can&rsquo;t 65% Shias make their own system of Imamat. But Kurd has got a Kurdish visionary leader who has prepared them and they are doing a referendum to formally separate from Iraq. This is happening in Iraq, they have made Kurdistan and the Shias are not ready to take the name of Imamat. They say if we take the name of Imamat sectarianism will start as if nothing has happened till now.<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/moq10.png" alt="" width="210" height="141" /> How much security has this democracy given to Iraq till now? This is tragedy of Iraq and it is possible that many such things can happen in Iraq till they revert towards Imamat. But there is hope from groups like Hashad al Shabi, which is awakened group of youths who have secured their nation from cruel terrorist group and we have hopes that they will further do the journey and one day Iraq will also get secured in the peaceful fortress of Imamat.</p>\r\n</div>', 'N', 'N', '15132459421512713681Moqtada.jpg', '', '15120628814_Aug_2017_(1)_(2).pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-24 04:58:37', 'Y');

Since this region is under a lot of political chaos and there are big plans that are made for this region specifically under the name of CPEC we will discuss this matter here. Gilgit Baltistan has its own history that at the time of independence of Pakistan in 1947 Gilgit Baltistan joined Pakistan in 1948. The locals with their efforts, battles finished the Dogra regime from there and joined Pakistan. The Pakistan rulership till date in seventy years did not have time, opportunity to accept Gilgit Baltistan joining Pakistan and make Gilgit Baltistan a part of Pakistan. For a long period this was a forsaken region but certain incidents that took place drew attention towards this region and many got anxious about it specifically certain groups within Pakistan got more interested in it. The countries outside Pakistan and specifically neighboring countries also started to give importance to it. We will not delve more inside the history of Gilgit Baltistan but focus more on the future of Gilgit Baltistan which is more important. Though historical knowledge is also necessary and no work has been done related to the history of Gilgit Baltistan; a very basic effort has been put which needs completion from various perspectives.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong> What is CPEC? </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img2_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="124" />At present in the current era this region is under a big catastrophe and that is a plan under the name of CPEC which means China Pakistan Economic Corridor. It is the economic or commercial route between China and Pakistan; this is a plan which is being implemented in Pakistan and this has raised the significance and importance of Gilgit Baltistan. The same region which was forsaken, abandoned by everyone and despite of many other attractions which were present in this region which were all neglected by the rulership category and also industrialists, commercial establishments and even the political parties also did not have any interest. It was to the extent that many people living in Pakistan were not even aware as to which northern region of Pakistan is Gilgit Baltistan. Even the people living in Gilgit Baltistan had no interest in their region and they were more inclined towards other regions like Punjab, Karachi for the purpose of education, living and other routine affairs. The CPEC plan has got the attention towards the region in a full-fledged way from inside the country, media and also outside. Hence the people of Pakistan should be aware about this plan as to what CPEC is and what is going to happen in this. The common people of Pakistan think that CPEC is a project to build roads (for transport) from China to Gwadar port. China in the present era is rising as an economic superpower and the effects of all this is and will be seen more on other political events globally. China is rising on the global economic horizon as new power. Whatever is happening under the banner of CPEC is a small part of a global plan of China. CPEC which itself is considered as a mega project in Pakistan and Pakistani&rsquo;s are confused as well since they are not aware. The media instead of making their community aware as to what is the reality behind this, what is happening in the world; they create more confusion and anxiety? Since Pakistan has a non- serious media CPEC has become a hot topic of anxiety and confusion. Though the non-serious temperament of Pakistani&rsquo;s is such that they don&rsquo;t get easily excited or anxious about things. Seriousness is required to become anxious about something but for our community Cricket is enough even if they don&rsquo;t understand CPEC. Since time is short I will discuss this topic just as a list and then we will come towards Gilgit Baltistan</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>China 2000 yrs before</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img3_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />China in the past has been an economic power; its culture, civilization is well known but specifically China has passed through a flourishing economy. Approximately until 2000 yrs back China has remained as economic power and it had trade relationships across the globe and even after that this superiority of China has remained established for decades across the world. The reason behind this has been many discoveries done inside China which were then developed and spread across the world. One of the famous historic industries of China has been silk. In textile industry even today silk has its own status and superiority. Today with the help of science artificial and industrial silk has also come up which has replaced the tradition of breeding silkworms which was done in the past by China and exported to the world. The trading route by which China was exporting silk across the world was known as Silk route which spread across Asia to Europe. It was passing through Pakistan, India, Asian states, Russian states and through Iran, Turkey it was reaching European market. China being an intellectual center is also well known and also in Islamic traditions it is found as seen in the famous tradition from Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) that you should be in pursuit of knowledge even if you have to travel to China. This was because China was one of the centers of knowledge. But eventually due to historical incidents this economic centralization of China came down and other states, nations also developed into big markets. The same products which were coming from China; other nations started to develop themselves. Then there were many battles and other political changes that took place in the history of China due to which China lost its global superiority.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Communist revolution in China</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img4_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="181" />In the last century where there were two major world wars which effected the entire world and China was also affected by that. In the vicinity of China, Japan which was also a military and economic power and was an opponent of China that affected China. This war was won by China against Japan but China also got broken and many areas under China got separated by various communities. This was the era in which Russia was heavily promoting socialist and communist thinking; and after Second World War there was an aggression of this socialist ideology from Russia which also had an effect on China. Communist got organized and Mao Tse Tung started the communist revolutionary movement and united the regions. There is a very small area that is outside the vicinity of China and China is not much effective there. Taiwan is still separate; Hong Kong was under Britain which China got back. China has gathered many of its territories coming out as a power. Mao Tse Tung is amongst the great leaders of the world who has changed history, united a community and given an identity to a community. This was the first leadership which gave political freedom to china from powers like Japan. In 1949, two years after formation of Pakistan; China started its new journey as united group of nations. This era passed then in the 70s and 80s China got one more leader.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img5_3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="211" />The Chinese system is such that there are not public elections there. The rulership is done by Communist party and they have their own Communist bureau and they select representatives from across the country; these representatives then select a central council and this council then selects the President. The President has a five years tenure after which the communist party meets and they again select the President. Like the current President&rsquo;s tenure was extended for another five years. The political system of China is very strong and China has become a role mode and reference globally specifically due to its economic growth and strength. Many nations want to follow the China model considering its strength to establish the economy of their nation. West is also following China in many economic policies. In China the leader, Presidents have been many as administrators but there have been three major leaders in China. There is a difference between administrator and leader. Administrator is the one who runs the state and establishes law and order. Leader establishes a nation and moves them towards the purpose. The administrative manger&rsquo;s role is to run the existing system in proper manner without any disturbance. A leader takes the nation out of the existing system into future.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately Pakistan has been deprived of both administrator and Leader. We are aware of other leaders in the world but no leader is born in this nation. Shaurish Kashmir who was a revolutionary activist at the time of independence has written that this land is barren to produce any leader like Allama Iqbal. There are reasons for this like there is no seriousness and many other weaknesses due to which this young generation despite of having potential gets wasted. The land is fertile but due to weaknesses everything is getting wasted. It is not that those who are not getting educated they are wasted but even those who are getting educated are wasted because what they study is just waste. They only study those sciences which can give them job and hence their personalities get wasted. Personalities are not made by studying the sciences which we are studying and are interested. These sciences which are useful in running factories do not make personalities. The sciences that make personalities are different from these like Philosophy, Sociology and makes personalities.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Three visionary leaders of China</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">China has seen three big leaders and one of these three is the one who has made this plan of CPEC for you. One was Mao Tse Tung who got freedom for China, organized them and gave a political identity to China. The second leader which gave economic foundation to China is a famous personality of his time Deng Xiaoping. He made China a big economic power. The existing China is his china that came out of this ideology. He was a leader with a vision with leadership qualities in context to their ideology and region. The third leader whom China has formally considered as their leader and made him as part of their constitution few days back is the current Chinese President Xi Jinping. These three leaders Mao Tse Tung, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping are of equal status and considered as leaders and not President. These are those who have their own political, communal, economical, global visions and the vision of this current President Xi Jinping has been accepted as a vision in constitution of China. He is the creator of a new vision from China under which China is creating a new global identity. This is the third step which China is taking; first was under the leadership of Mao Tse Tung; then under Deng Xiaoping China became an economic power and the third step which has just started under the leadership of Xi Jinping.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/midbanner.jpg" alt="" width="748" height="297" /></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The vision he has given now is the third phase of the same vision given by the two previous leaders. In the first phase China achieved political stability under Mao. Then after becoming a political power instead of fiddling with neighboring countries they focused completely inside China to make it strong economically which was done by Xiaoping and made China a pole of industrial world. Now on the bases of the political and economic stability achieved the third step is being taken to establish a global identity for China and also a full dominance of China over the world. China has still not achieved this recognition that it is or it can dominate over all the nations of the world. China is very strict on one thing; that is when they were of Buddhist ideology they did not adopt Buddhism as a religion and when they became communist they did not accept communism the way Russians did. The Russians attempted to develop a visionary precedence over the world and they captured a big part of the world ideologically and in many place socialist, communist revolutions took place in almost all continents. Almost half of Western Europe came under dominance of communism and many other nations of American continent and still some nations like Cuba and Venezuela still have a very weak communism. Russians exported communism globally but China despite of being communist is not a propagator of communism. China has used communism more as a tool rather than as an Ideology. At present China has communism but this is political communism in which there is a communist party which is not sensitive towards the religion of Chinese people. Like Christianity is spreading fast across China. China is sensitive towards Islam and don&rsquo;t give free hand to Muslims because they become extremist and spread terrorist type Islam. The Salafism started to spread quickly in China due to which china controlled it in a hard way. For Christianity is spreading on ground and there are no restrictions on it. China is not sensitive about Communism as a vision either inside China or outside; like China does not wants to bring Communism in Pakistan or Asia. They have kept communism only as a means and tool. They don&rsquo;t even care even if the members of their communist national party become religious. This is the difference between Chinese and Russian communism</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong> One Belt, One Road &ndash; New vision of China </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img6_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="143" />China has first used this communism as a means of political stability and economic growth and beyond this they are not concerned about communism. The system which China has made for the world is one that china should be superior across the world in terms of economy. China has got this feeling that they can establish their dominance over the world and they have taken steps also under Xi Jinping. Jinping wants to return the same 2000 yrs old economic status to China. A conference was done few months back and around 36 leaders of the world participated and accepted the policy of &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo;. This is the same old Silk route which connects the entire world. China has once again renewed the same policy and this is a very unique plan for China. Some try to interpret these things in superstitious manner as Gog and Magog incidents that the reappearance of Imam (a.t.f.s) is about to happen. The actual plan is this &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo; and not CPEC which is just a small part of this plan. This Silk route was an intercontinental route which passed through dry lands and caravans would travel by road on this. The new plan which China has made has both land as well as sea connectivity. They have made one sea route to get some nations under its influence and another route by land which will connect to Europe. In fact some part of this route is already connected to some parts of Europe. There is a trade route that connects the entire world and this is a very unique plan for China. They are making railway lines, wide roads and sea routes. The actual plan is to make a route from China to Germany and Italy in Europe. The big part of this Chinese corridor is in this region and the sea route is also through Indian Ocean. China has taken all the major ports in the Indian Ocean and amongst them one is our Gwadar port. From this huge; One belt, One road plan which is around 13000 to 15000 kms route is the plan of China made by Jinping as per his vision. The estimate which they have made for this project is five trillion dollar. A small part of this route which is around 1300 kms comes in Pakistan known as CPEC. This is not a Pakistan China economic plan; it is China Pakistan Economy plan. This is also part of this big Silk route revival plan. This route has been opened by China to approach global markets and one leg of this big route passes through Pakistan. This starts from China Pakistan border.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">You have to keep this in mind that china is much bigger nation than Pakistan. In terms of population they are more than 1.3 billion and geographically also it is a vast land but with one specific that on 40% of Chinese land 94% population lives. This means the major part of Chinese land is mountainous and not populated. The second point is that most of the population of China lives near the sea; the Eastern China and Western China. The border that touches Pakistan from China is an empty zone and very lowly populated that is the 6%. The major population of China is on Eastern part of China and this itself is a problem for China whereby there is no balance of population distribution as the load of entire population of China is on one part. The way China wants to become influencing, effective in the outside world it also wants to create a population distribution balance inside China. They want to transfer their population across the Western border which is mostly empty. For this they have made internally also big roads, railways even though it is a tough terrain but with the help of technology they have done all this construction. China might be the only country who has railways up to their border because generally trains are used in and between cities but China has made this to the border. Like the mountainous region which touches India; China has made roads reaching all the mountains peaks whereas for India the difficulty is that not even non concrete roads are present in mountains on their side. Sometime back the conflict that took place on the India China border was for this reason only that China has made big highway on the border which India claimed that this has made their border insecure. China has some plans and it is proceeding with a big plan.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Secrecy &ndash; Code of Success for Chinese </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Chinese are very secretive community; they only tell the world what is required to be told and not inform everyone about everything they are doing or plan to do. Even till now they have not even told Pakistan completely about CPEC as to what they are planning to do. They have only told to the extent it is required to be told. And this is the secret of their success that they do not reveal their secrets till the time the secrets are endangered. This One belt One road was only told to the leaders of thirty six countries to the extent it was required to be told and there was no danger to them. They have not told any further details to anyone.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">CPEC is the route that starts from Khunjrad border area in north Pakistan and goes up to Gwadar port. There are some roads which they have to make here; they have to make a train route, roads for vehicle and for production of electricity China has to put some power plants in some cities which are already identified but they have only informed Pakistan to the extent required; like they have told Pakistan to prepare the plot and Pakistanis are doing that.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>CPEC Funding as loan to Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img7_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="143" />One more interesting dimension of China is that this is a mega investment of 5 Trillion dollar; from where will they bring this much funding. From CPEC you can estimate how they will arrange this much funding. China has granted Pakistan a budget of 46 billion dollar for CPEC project. This was a loan to Pakistan in 2016 and in 2017 a review has been done and this have been revised to 54 billion dollar. This will go forward and might even cross 60 billion dollar until completion. All this is loan given to Pakistan which Pakistan has to return back in thirty years with interest. China is building their own route on the land of Pakistan and is being made by them; no contract has been given to Pakistani companies for technical, engineering work and only some basic labor work might be given to Pakistan. All this is debt of 46 billion dollar on Pakistan which they have to return in thirty years as 90 billion dollar including interest. Pakistan will not take anything instead China will themselves spend 46 billion which will increase every year but will take 90 billion dollar back. This money is given as loan to Pakistan and used for giving contracts to Chinese companies to build the route which means this loan money will also go back to China.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Despite of this for Pakistan this project has an importance because it is seventy years that Pakistan never got the opportunity to make any national policy like a 5, 10, 50 yrs plan which would happen if a stable political government would have come and done this. The most useless government of Saudi Arabia has also made a 30 yrs plan to modernize Saudi Arabia. That is a separate topic as to what is going to happen in Saudi Arabia and these fools Ale Saud are also planning to fly like China. It is like a frog who saw a falcon flying and decided that he will also fly but did not realize that he is not having wings too fly. Saudi has a plan to build the most modern city of world in Saudi Arabia near Red Sea with a budget of 5 trillion dollar.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Effects of CPEC on Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img8_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="110" />China has made this CPEC plan but still this is important for Pakistan because Pakistan is running without policy. There is only one policy of Pakistan which is related to the India Pakistan enmity which is required to be existing in the interests of both. Whenever India needs something they blow the trumpet of Pakistan enmity and similarly Pakistan uses it for Indian enmity. They create this noise of enmity to resolve their internal issues but for the development of country Pakistan has nowhere made any policy. The Military government comes and somehow runs the government, making their own money; then civilian government comes which does corruption and everyone is looting. We can say that the only policy present in Pakistan is looting, robbing and usurping which is adopted by all categories of people. They don&rsquo;t work out a plan for 5, 10, 50 yrs plan as to how Pakistan will grow, develop and reach where. This is the only country which can run the nation for four years without a foreign minister. But such a powerful infrastructure that comes up in terms of big roads and power plant has some benefit for Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is no doubt that when a such big transport infrastructure is created there will be some benefits for Pakistan but here also there is a separate argument as to whether Pakistani vehicles will be permitted or not to drive on these roads because the planning done by China related to number of Chinese trucks will pass in a minute on this road is different. If you see those figures then that does not looks like even a Pakistani motorcycle will be allowed to pass on the route. The interesting thing is that this route will pass through the center of Pakistan as Pakistan geographical is more in length and width is short; all these roads are being made length wise. These roads will pass touching the cities of Pakistan and they have the vision to also make new cities in fifty years and power plants will be made. But all this is under the wisdom and planning of China and Pakistan is not involved in this planning at all. China has done this planning, engineering and design all for Pakistan themselves. They have not asked Pakistan and neither is Pakistan interested to ask them.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is also a negative opinion present on this which is that Pakistan will permanently lose its economic independence and will become a slave nation of China forever. The industries, agriculture, development will end in Pakistan and it will all be Chinese plans. We can see the signs of this already. If we can study the history of India then similar facts are seen here amongst which formally Chinese language has been started to be taught in Pakistan. The government institutes have made this obligatory to learn Chinese for their officers and staff. Though China is coming to Pakistan and they should be learning our language but it is opposite. This means the influence of China will be increasing in Pakistan and you will have daily contacts with Chinese everywhere. You don&rsquo;t have to learn Chinese so you can sell bread to some Chinese but this is required because all the official instructions will be given to you in Chinese language. Your entire economy will be dependent on China and for this learning Chinese language is necessary. When India came into slavery of British it was exactly as per the same conspiracy. East India Company came to India in pretext of business from one port. They asked permission from one port for trading and then gradually they made entire India as slave. When East India Company came the national language was Persian before the British came. The British came and changed the education medium to English and from that time you have been learning English. Now your medium will also change and it will become Chinese. To change language of a nation has a very deep precise meaning. When some country comes inside and changes the language then this is a sign towards the same slavery. Those analysts who have this negative views have strong evidence that this has happened before whereby India became slave and we are now going in the same direction. Today we have nothing to deal with China and it is China that is doing everything and hence this is a view that Pakistan will become slave of China. The business, market, industry will be all from China and Pakistani will only work as a labor and help them. They will work in their offices and they will get salary from Chinese owners of Pakistani company.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">China has made this plan of CPEC for Pakistan and this is starting from Gilgit in Pakistan. Baltistan remains at one side and this route passes from Gilgit for a long distance and this enters Khyber Pakhtoon Khan; and from there into Punjab and then it branches into Sindh and Balochistan. We can interpret CPEC as a white powerful elephant and in front of it you can assume a weak creature like Rabbit. If we see Gilgit Baltistan they are like a weak rabbit; timid, afraid and it has nothing. Now this big elephant has to pass over this weak Rabbit so what will happen to it? The effects of this CPEC route is over entire Pakistan but we are only discussing in context to Gilgit Baltistan. The tragedy with Gilgit Baltistan is such that in seventy years the rulers of Pakistan have proven their complete ineligibility for this region. They have given at least some importance to Kashmir but no attention has been paid towards Gilgit Baltistan.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong> China in pursuit of Global supremacy over America </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img9_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="143" />One more dimension is necessary to be mentioned here which is also related to Gilgit Baltistanthat this plan of china is a sharp attack on America. This act of China is to end the power of America. America is the world&rsquo;s most powerful military and economic power. They are number one in economy and then China is after them. But as per XI Jinpeng planning China will take an economic jump and will go much forward than America and America will not be able to even reach near China. If this planning of Xi Jinpeng becomes successful of which possibilities are high then America will no more remain an economic power; it will become a second economy in the world and its effectiveness from the world will go away. Another thing which China has done as regards to this strategy which they have never done in the past but last week they have announced that China will now keep their army on priority over economy. This was not before whereby Chinese forces never participated in any global battles though they had some minor wars with India before. As per Xi Jinpeng army will be their first priority now and then economy. China will make the most modern force of the world and for this they have made their infrastructure. They have made the economic infrastructure and then spread it across the world and in last ten to fifteen years they have modified their military infrastructure as well. As such the Chinese military is a biggest army in terms of number of people; that is around 3 million. Now they want to equip their army with latest technology, supersonics, air warfare technology, missile technology and they are already an atomic technology. In 2017 itself China has taken a big step and made the first Naval Air fleet which are used for launching aircrafts from sea with complete Air squad and control room which can go into any sea. This fleet has been made first time by China and they have launched in sea and this is a big forward step which China has taken. America has very well realized that China is not just a simple competition to America but China also wants to wipe away the American leadership position. There is no doubt that this is what is going to happen that China will wipe off America because the potential which China has is not there with America. China has not interfered anywhere though there are some clashes with their neighboring countries but at a global level China carries a status in global institutes. It has no enmity with any country and everyone wants to befriend China because of its economy. At present from Europe; atomic power like France, then Italy, Spain are getting near to China so that with the help of China Europe can stabilize its position against America. Now China has also taken a big step in military power and as I said being secretive is the code of success for China. They do not allow the world to understand and they have made such a closed society that it is very difficult for information to leak and to do espionage on them. Their enemies buy off some Chinese but the system inside China is so strong that they cannot break through. There are thousands of people from communist party hanged in last five years on slightest doubt that this Chinese officer has got affiliated with some Western country. They run the trial at night, morning they hang and do not act with any mercy to give time. They don&rsquo;t want the Chinese secrets to leak out to anyone. This secret system has made China very secure.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">America has been terrorized by China at present and Trump has been selected for this only. I have mentioned this at that time when Trump was elected that Trump has been selected for American leadership with a proper planning. He had lost the election against Hilary and in a fraudulent manner they got him elected. They wanted this wrestler to stand against China. As such he runs wrestling business and Casinos, night clubs which are the main source of his income. They have got this person to confront China in a wrestling style. All the policies which Trump is making like whatever he is doing with Iran, Pakistan are all preparations for confronting China. He is making strategies to fight China. Since he is a champion of Wrestling he is doing in that style whereas China is a champion in acting with wisdom, planning and secrecy hence they are moving in that style. America at present is a victim of panic.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">China and India are in severe conflict. India is not a big power but has a desire to become a superpower. In terms of population India is number two; its geography is big, has inclination towards industrialization and in certain segments India has earned global fame. In this region after China the name of India comes up. China and India have conflicts at border and they are enemies also of each other. One reason for China selecting Pakistan is because America has selected India for confronting China. There is a definite war going to happen between China and America but it won&rsquo;t be a direct war instead a proxy war that would be fought on some other land which China or America will decide. If America decides than that war can happen in Taiwan or Pakistan or in some Asian state; it is the same way the war is being fought in Syria. This is a proxy war whereby two enemies fight on the battle field of someone else. If China selects the battlefield then it could be that place which will incur loss on America and similarly America will select that place which gives loss to China. The way Taiwan is important to China the same importance is there for Pakistan as well. China considers Taiwan as part of its territory geographically but for Pakistan the Chinese General of a special force they have made for guarding the CPEC was questioned. He was asked by European journalists that you give a lot of importance to Pakistan and now Pakistan is also coming in opposition to America, not listening to America and in rebellion; and you have spoiled the relation of Pakistan and America. The reply this Chinese General gave was that the importance which Pakistan has for China is same which Israel has for America. The way Israel does not listens to anyone because America is that their back he says same way Pakistan is now (because China is at its back). China has to get a lot of work done through Pakistan against India. America has to take a lot of work from India against China.America is massaging India now, strengthening its muscles to prepare them for China. Similarly China is massaging Pakistan for preparation against India. Hence this region is gradually becoming a camp of many major incidents to happen.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong> Clash of two big elephants in Gilgit Baltistan</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">We have only kept our eyes on roads but the issues getting developed under footnotes is not being pondered over by analysts. There is no seriousness adopted on this matter that if these two big elephants of America and China fight then what will happen. This has already started whereby India has already lodged a request in UN that CPEC should not pass through Gilgit Baltistan because it is a disputed territory; it is not decided that whether Gilgit Baltistan belongs to Pakistan or India. Since it belongs to Kashmir India claims it belongs to us whereas Pakistan claims Kashmir belongs to them. India has given a formal writ in UN that this CPEC should be stopped with Global pressure on China and Pakistan because this is passing through disputed territory and that disputed land is Gilgit Baltistan. Thus Gilgit Baltistan is conceiving the semen of major events in future. Hence the importance of Gilgit Baltistan has become abnormal now. For China CPEC is very important as they have already spent and what they are going to spend is a big investment and they want this to be successful. India wants to stop CPEC and in fact they want to stop the entire one belt one road plan of China so as to stop China becoming more powerful. America is putting all efforts to prepare against China. They are preparing Taiwan on one side, then Ukraine on some side and then India. They are all alliances of America and Middle East which Obama has left them on their own; he said they are a liability and burden on us and told them that we are not going to pamper you anymore. Trump came and did the opposite; he started to pamper the Arabs again because now he needs them to confront China. This is because the route which China is making is going to fulfill one big need of oil and energy transportation from Middle East. At present from the current route by sea it takes 90 days for an oil vessel to reach China from UAE or Saudi Arabia. But if it reaches from CPEC route it will be there in 8 to 9 days. China is making roads, routes to transfer oil and gas into their country and America has started to capture oil wells in Saudi, Emirate, Kuwait and Qatar. America does not wants them to sell oil to China and this is the reason why American interests have gone so high in Arab nations. Obama has made some other policy and Trump has made some other policy for which this Wrestler was bought in the arena. He has started besieging China from all around; from sea route of West, from land and all other ways. In order to break Pakistan America has started to apply unordinary pressure on Pakistan; every day they threaten Pakistan. Tillerson was in Pakistan last week and sitting here he has scolded them. The Pakistani media said that it was the first time that Pakistan has not welcomed the American Foreign Minister and this was the only revenge they have taken by not going to airport but could not give any reply to him across the table. These two elephants have already clashed and the regions which come under this clash the first one is Gilgit Baltistan. When two elephants fight then the small creatures under the feet get crushed and nothing is left from them.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Negligence towards Gilgit Baltistan by Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The way I said that our government since seventy years has been negligent about Gilgit Baltistan. Even the people and local leadership of Gilgit Baltistan have also been negligent. If the government has not granted them any political status then the people, leadership of Gilgit Baltistan have also not desired or demanded anything. Even now the demands from the people of region is not for granting any political status or recognition of their identity or asking for any share in CPEC. There is nothing for Gilgit Baltistan in CPEC; only the road will pass through the region but there is nothing else for Gilgit Baltistan in this. Even the distribution center market where the goods from China will come they have made the depot in Havelian which is in KPK (Khaibar Pakhtoon Khan). They have not given anything to Gilgit Baltistan in this; they should have at least made one power plant there to give them energy as it is such a deprived region. An entire plan is passing through there but not giving anything. It is like a milking cow which rampages through a field and then goes to its stable to give milk there. This is our situation that they are passing through our area but nothing is given to us. The reason for this is that the sense which was required to be present in that region is not there. There was no awakening done and people also did not demand and played any character.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Infiltration of India and America in Gilgit Baltistan </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img10_3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="157" />At present India also wants this region to make it disputable. America is also arousing India on this matter and US also has high interest in Gilgit Baltistan. The US aids that are given in this region is the means of penetrating this region so that they can create problems for China and this plan. These sacks of rice, flour given by NGO&rsquo;s as aids from USA is not free. As the Americans say there are no free lunches. There is something to be paid against this. These rice, flour coming in every house of Gilgit Baltistan is not free; they have to do something against them. India is infiltrating and creating their agents in Gilgit Baltistan so that they can start a rebellion against Pakistan in this region. Indian agents are not necessarily some Hindu or Sikh but instead it could be some Pakistani only who will rise up and say that we are not getting our rights and will start a rebellion against Pakistan. These demands, reasons would be true also because to the extent a region can remain deprived of their rights has been already done with Gilgit Baltistan. They cannot deprive them beyond these as they don&rsquo;t have the power to deprive more else they would have done that also. Even beyond CPEC this region has other importance as well. CPEC has just made Gilgit Baltistan as a tool but as such it has its own geographical and economic importance. It is a biggest tourist point of Pakistan and due to insecurity this tourism has not prospered. There is a local potential in the region but there has been no plan made to capitalize the potential of this region and now only because CPEC route is passing through Gilgit Baltistan it has got some importance. This is a big mistake of Pakistan that they are passing a Silky and Golden route through are region whose population has been kept deprived. In other words they are giving an opportunity to the enemies; India will come and arouse them that see CPEC is passing through your region and there is nothing for you. You will just do the work of loaders and provide labor services. The Pakistan military has made a special brigade to protect CPEC. This is a useless work they have done because already a Brigade is present in Gilgit Baltistan which is the people of Gilgit Baltistan. This is the brigade which has got freedom for Gilgit Baltistan from Dogra, separating them from India and getting it joined Pakistan. If they can do this then this Brigade can save the CPEC also from the evils of America and India but if these people would have been trusted. This corruption has been done by political parties whereby they take a small commission and keep the community deprived. They take some small meager contracts or job for their children and family; thus keeping the community and people deprived from their rights. One more tragedy which has happened in Gilgit Baltistan is the interference of political parties. First no one would even visit there but since 2009 they are visiting there that is after People&rsquo;s Party gave a very strange face to this region. They did not make it a province, state or independent or made a separate constitution. They did not even issue an ordinance and instead with just a notification they did everything. If they would have given it a constitutional status then this region would have been secure from India and would not have been presented in international organizations as a disputed region and America would also not have eyed on it. CPEC which is an important plan for Pakistan but at the same time for Gilgit Baltistan this is a very sensitive issue. What is required in Gilgit Baltistan is first the awareness of the people of region about this CPEC.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>China besieging India </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The way America is trying to besiege China; like they are trying to buy out oil wells. So the road will be of China but oil wells will be of America. Similarly China is also besieging India; the way America is massaging India the same way China is massaging Pakistan so if India does something Pakistan will reply. China has besieged India from the sea sides. China has taken all the strategic ports around India. They have not just taken Gwadar port; they have taken the Port of Myanmar, then they have taken Chittagong port of Bangladesh. Then there is Sri Lanka below India and the port of Sri Lanka has also been taken over by China. There are some islands in Indian Ocean which also China has claimed that these islands belong to China. The other regions like Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia; China is taking the strategic points on rent. This is all to control India in case America arouses India to stand against China. This means no sea route help will be available for India if there is a battle. The ports are now presently for trading by china but if the need comes they can become war ports. This is a big encounter whereby America will not lose its status so easily. It will put all possible efforts to maintain its global leading position. The American power has become lazy in the world and the steps which Trump has taken to recover has done more damage and weakened it further. People are getting afraid of America now because of the tyranny, oppression which America has done. The policy of America is that it takes a dagger to other countries whereas China goes with a carrot. These are the two policies at present; whereby China is taking their economy power whereas America like for Pakistan brings threats, forces and bombs. It is not that China likes Pakistan or favors them. Chinese are the most disloyal community who only have personal interests. They don&rsquo;t like any relationship with anyone but they are only concerned about their interests. If you see the various tyrannies and oppressions going around the world in which China has not taken any step like in Palestine, Myanmar or Kashmir. They do not have any sympathy towards Muslims or anyone in general. If China is a friend of some nation then for sure there lies a benefit for Chinese in it. China is not ready for any sacrifice for anyone. But their policy is that they go to every nation with a carrot that is an economic policy. They said we will develop Tajikistan, Iran.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Iran made agreement with India for Chabahar port and then China gave an offer to Iran which is about to end the agreement with India. China is making attempt to make Iran also part of CPEC though Iran is connected on the One Belt. At present the train route which China has made is connected with Iran and experimental train has run on this route from Peking to Tehran and this route goes up to Germany. Now China is trying to link Iran also through the land route. This is because after Gwadar the next point is in Iran which is the Chabahar port and it also has land route from Iran to Pakistan. This is also in benefit of Iran and it is possible if Pakistan gets freedom from American clutches then this route can also work out. This is possible that even if Pakistan does not desire still China will get Pakistan out from the clutches of America as this has become a need for China. It is not that Pakistan hates America but it is the need of China that Pakistan should separate from America. If this happens that Pakistan gets separated from America then Pakistan will get connected with Iran. At present there are two big burdens on Pakistan; one is from America and second from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is under the clutches of America because America is showing King Salman and his son big green gardens. Prince Mohammad Salman has announced that we are now doing a reversion towards a Saudi Arabia before 1979. This means before 1979 which was the year of Iranian revolution after which Saudi came aggressively in Shia enmity but he is saying that we are going to leave that enmity. They want to now develop Saudi Arabia as a modern state and place of tourism. The day the evil of America ends the same day Saudi will end and on the same day Iran and Pakistan will connect.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Gilgit Baltistan &ndash; Sensitive and Strategic point </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In this situation Gilgit Baltistan is the most sensitive point whereby India is making attempts through Gilgit Baltistan to foil the CPEC plan. America will use Gilgit Baltistan to do the same and create rebellion there. For Pakistan also it is of strategic importance that it protects Gilgit Baltistan and brings out a secure route to other regions. You should be attentive that both India and America wants to create rebellion, uprisings against Pakistan through the people of this region. This is the planning and strategy. The Pakistani forces are not making the same policy to counter this conspiracy through the people of Gilgit Baltistan. In fact they are waiting for India and America to start some rebellion in Gilgit Baltistan and Pakistan should crush the rebellion through military power. This is where the people of Gilgit Baltistan should be well aware and awakened that one is trying to arouse the people and other is preparing to crush them if they rise. This is foolishness and immaturity that you are preparing to crush the people with a separate Brigade instead you should get the people along; give them some part of CPEC which benefits the region. They are now doing opposite by usurping the lands of Gilgit Baltistan; the government, agents and forces are trying to usurp the land there.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">This will create more mistrust and more possibility of rebellion. Who has shown them this foolish path because as such that region is deprived a lot and now when some foreign plan has come up then you should take advantage of that and give development , welfare to the region and its people. The more the people will get facilities in the region they themselves will become a force to counter the conspiracies there. This strategy has never been made practical in Pakistan. The British did this and all these regions which are disputed the British adopted a strategy in these regions to protect themselves from Afghanistan. In order to protect themselves from the aggression of Afghanistan and Iran they made this buffer zone in between whereby they developed tribes, armed them, and gave them authority to take care of this region. And it was never that British had to fight in this region. The tribes protected everything and this was the British policy to develop them for this purpose.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">This is the best solution for Pakistan that they should immediately make Gilgit Baltistan as a province of Pakistan and grant them authority and give all the facilities to the people of this region from Chinese money if you don&rsquo;t want to spend from your own. The place where India and America are infiltrating you should give protection to that region so that the people will protect the region and the CPEC plan. They will not come under the enemy influence. But it is very difficult that someone will think on these lines in this country specifically those who are power hungry who always want to crush people. For the sake of crushing people do not burn your own region. This is foolishness to burn your own house.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Awareness and Awakening for the people of Gilgit Baltistan</strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img11_3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="208" /></strong> First of all the people of Gilgit Baltistan should become aware, awaken and get all the rights from government. This is the right time because once the route becomes active you will not get anything. In fact people would be exiled from the region as being an obstacle and creating insecurity. It is possible that you might be exiled later if you raise your voice for the rights at that time. This is the time where all categories should unitedly in seriousness get their rights but keep yourself secure from political parties. The political parties are merchants who will talk for the people but take the contracts for themselves. They come as representative of people and then get contracts, plots, rents for their own. You will see and can find now also what all these politicians have got for their own. Hence the sensible people, youths of this region with wisdom, seriousness take steps. The beggars would not get anything; they are kicked out and cornered. The way this region joined Pakistan on the first day that is the right path even though Pakistan did not grant any formal status to the region yet. As I said that the people of this region who were able to get freedom from Dogra&rsquo;s and make it part of Pakistan provided they stand on their own. The most important thing to remember is that when this elephant passes then it will crush everthing; not just economy, land but your culture, civilization as well as this elephant is merciless.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Imamat, Wilayat &ndash; The true identity of Gilgit Baltistan </strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/img12_1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" />The actual identity of Gilgit Baltistan is the vision of Imamat and Wilayat and this is the vision which can keep this region firm and stable. It should not happen that we abandon this vision of Imamat. I can feel that a wave has started which is of secularism within the youths of this region that if we remain with religion we will suffer. This Satanic thought is very dangerous. If you have been loyal to Pakistan then it is due to the vision of Wilayat and if they have got freedom from Dogra regime then it was due to this vision of Wilayat. If till the time this region, community despite of being so deprived have not done anything then this is because their Ideology teaches this to them. But it is not that you should forsake your vision. At present the biggest threat for youths of this region is that from visionary perspective which they are going towards Secularism. I can see this threat from their talks, dresses that they are trying to show that we are modern. They are wearing T Shirts in minus temperature. They wear Jeans and try to show we are modern. This modernism is a deception which comes from Western dresses. You wear Salwar Kameez, get educated and remain on your religion; loyal to your nation.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">If they (government) are not doing anything then you should yourself make College, Universities, Technical centers for your people. You make Industrialization plans for your people yourself. People from other parts of the country visit there and tell that there is so much potential for hydro power; there are abundant dry fruits there. Why can&rsquo;t the people there think about the minerals and tourist places which is their capital and without the help of China on their own efforts they can do all this. This has to come along with the vision and under the shadow of Wilayat. The vision that can make all this happen is that of Wilayat only; else to go after the tails of this and that; and the games which political parties have played there has been witnessed by all. In future also it is the awareness and sense of the people that will keep them firm. This seventy years of deprivation will go away God willing with the efforts of the people and the dangers that are hovering over the heads of people; they should be attentive by the youths. They should not get bewildered by others. We pray that people of that region will develop it and come out of deprivation. It would not be good to hear that China has developed Gilgit Baltistan instead it should be that people of Gilgit Baltistan have developed it. This would be a medal for us. The way the people of Gilgit Baltistan had got freedom for the region; they should develop this region and also protect it from others. It should not happen that we leave this region on the mercy of others and that will not be the right state. Allah (s.w.t) also says that Allah changes the state of the community only when they change themselves. Now the time has come for the people to make, develop this region themselves and this region God willing will become the starting point for the system of Wilayat and Imamat in this country.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><em> Translated By &ndash; Jamea Orwatul Wuthqa</em></p>', 'N', 'N', '15132460571512063517banner3.jpg', '', '1512063517Analysis_(1).pdf', 'A', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:07:37', 'Y');

After a break once again a wave of killings have started in Balochistan. Pakistan has been surrounded by difficulties since forty years and these problems are those which are created by Pakistan itself. The useless rulers, establishment has jumped themselves and entire country into this fire. Our rulers have gambled and they lost everything in that gamble. They started a gamble in Afghanistan, by getting deceived by the Satan&rsquo;s and for their personal gains and they lost everything in that gamble. The effects of that loss is coming out one after another. Sometimes terrorism, sectarianism, political instability, economic crisis and what is happening today in Balochistan is part of the same story.</p>\r\n<p>The tragedy of Balochistan is related to the new story which Pakistan has started by tying up with China and America does not like this. China and Pakistan are enemies of India as wellbeing their neighbors. India might not care much about Pakistan but for China they are concerned. China is a global power and also is becoming a super power and is trying to become dominant over other powers. They have the ability and the way their direction is they can reach there. As I said before in one lecture that the current Chinese President has started the third plan which is presented by him. First vision was by Mao who got freedom on China, then Ping came and made it an economic power and the current President has given a vision, political wisdom which has become a part of their constitution whereby he wants to make China a global superpower. It is confirmed for China that in the next decade China will be an absolute power. First china was not intervening into politics but now they are also becoming political.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/1_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" />America which was a superpower is becoming weak day by day and its downfall journey has started; its pillars are coming down. It will take some time for the rise of China and fall of America. It will take some time for this to happen but as it happens many countries will come under direct influence and Pakistan has already come under this now. This is because Pakistan is one of the part of the Chinese policy. In the China policy one of them is CPEC which is not acceptable to India and America. For this they have made a comprehensive policy which as per reports from News agency India has allocated 55 billion Indian rupees as budget to counter CPEC. They have the budget of 46 billion in Pakistan and theirs is 55 billion. In order to counter the Chinese move they are doing all this and the visit of Trump recently in the region was also for this purpose only. The countries in which China is having a strategy and plan, America has also a plan for the same countries and both are now in auction. Every country will not assess, calculate which plan is profitable from them. The plans that are made by China is difficult for America to counter in this region as these Asian countries will mostly move towards China only.</p>\r\n<p>Japan and China are longtime enemies like India and Pakistan. This is because China was under control of Japan for a long time and Japanese consider Chinese as disgraced, lowly community. They have a communal difference amongst them hence Japan in this region will remain as American representative. Even though they have one culture, religion but due to this enmity they will not come near. The extremism between China and Japan is very high; as the difference is ideological, cultural and hence they will not come close easily. Thus Japan will favor America only but other countries will most probably incline towards China.</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan has come under the influence of Chinese strategy and the elements of unforeseen incidents are being gathered inside Pakistan mainly in two areas; one Gilgit and second Balochistan. For these two areas India by the alliance of Israel, America wants to destabilize these two regions. One region is the beginning of CPEC where it starts from Gilgit and it ends in Balochistan. India has started to create tensions, pressure in both these regions. When both the starting and ending point becomes insecure then the importance of central region of Punjab, Sindh where CPEC will pass has no signifance. They are trying to create a plan of disturbance in such a manner that this CPEC plan of China turns out to be expensive for China and both Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>China has kept this condition before only that if there is security, peace in Pakistan then only CPEC will start. This plan is conditional to peace in Pakistan. The establishment has given them commitment that there will be peace, security on this CPEC route. From there they have plans to make these two start and end points instable. Balochistan was already prepared from beginning whereby armed tribes were present since long, much before the creation of Pakistan. They were battling tribes not under any government who were following their tribal heads. This area has a history of armed tribal combats. Gilgit Baltistan was not like that and the tribal system here was not like Balochistan. But they are trying to create insecurity even in Gilgit Baltistan to the extent possible. They want to start insecurity on religious grounds in Gilgit Baltistan because the religious element is stronger in Gilgit Baltistan then tribalism. They have started a new wave in Balochistan and a message is being given that there is no stability in Balochistan. From here attempts are made to keep Balochistan peaceful but it&rsquo;s not happening and this story will proceed further. India has clearly said this in international organization and given complaints that this is a disputable zone and CPEC should not pass from here. It is possible that India might with some influence even get some opinion in their favor from global organizations. They are not able to get a resolution passed because China also has a decisive position in global political organizations. Hence they are preparing for a brutal conflict in this region by America and India against china. Hence these killings in Balochistan is part of this plan of America and India.</p>\r\n<p>Second reason behind this is the election in 2018 in Pakistan. Though no one is sure whether elections will happen or not but Pakistanis are not concerned if it happens or not; they are concerned about preparations. A lot of preparation for elections has started and media creates this anxiety more.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Afghanistan being prepared for ISIS, Taliban conflicts</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/2_1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="153" />Afghanistan is being strictly prepared for a new wave of incidents and the wrestlers are being massaged. They are preparing the teams there and the two teams that are going to counter in Afghanistan are ISIS and Taliban. There will be a battle within them and this battle will influence Pakistan and then Iran. And this is being planned also for these two countries. At present 30 to 35 percent part of Afghanistan is under control of Taliban and not government. And the areas of government control ISIS is being populated as they are being moved from Syria, Iraq into Afghanistan. America is moving ISIS into Afghanistan and making them strong in Afghanistan. They will use the Arab wealth and most of the resources for ISIS will be from Afghanistan only but some are being moved by America by NATO and their own aircrafts to Afghanistan. Trump is making a justification of providing the needs of their forces present in Afghanistan and under its cover they are provisioning ISIS. On the other hand Taliban is there whereby Russia is getting more attentive towards them. The countries that are with Russia wants to support Afghan Taliban. Pakistan is also inclined and is supporting Afghani Taliban whereas India is supporting the Pakistani Taliban. These two groups are busy in strengthening Taliban whereas America is doing the same for ISIS. These two bulls will fight but not in Afghanistan; they will do that in Iran and Pakistan. Taliban will attack American interests and ISIS will attack Iranian interests using Afghanistan. A full preparation has been done and media either due to fear or some plan does not discusses this but Afghanistan has been prepared in a dreadful manner and upcoming events would be deadly. This has one relationship with China as well. It is evident when a group like ISIS gets developed in Afghanistan then this would be dangerous for China as well. China will also support Taliban because that will be the shield for protection from ISIS. The extremist thinking people of Pakistan also wants to strengthen Afghan Taliban preserving them for this future conflict. It is clear that this would be destruction for Afghanistan as well whether it is ISIS or Taliban because both are the branches of same devilish tree of Takfirism. Their first target will be Shias only whether in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Earthquake on Iran Iraq border</strong></p>\r\n<p>One more grievous incident that has taken place last week was the severe earthquake on Iran Iraq border. It was more than 7.2 hector sale which is counted amongst big quakes and around six hundred persons have lost their lives, more than thousands are injured and big financial losses have happened. We pray for the forgiveness of the deceased and May Allah give cure and health to the injured and may Allah protect everyone from such incidents.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nine insane steps of Mohammad Bin Salman&rsquo;s Spider politics</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The top of the list topic globally is still Saudi Arabia. Whatever is happening in Saudi are all in a dramatic way since last two or three years. In fact from the time Salman became the King and his accursed son Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince Saudi has changed its policies dramatically. Saudi had already worsened their situation but these two; father and son have deviated from the conventional Saudi politics and adopted a new political way. Until now Saudi had family rule and it was always Ale Saud which as a family was ruling the country even though king was one person but they have divided the country amongst family members. The wealth, oil, politics and all affairs of the state was under family and they were not giving any authority to anyone outside the family unless it became a must. Everything was exclusive to this family and the family as such is also very big. The host of this family had twenty one wives so you can imagine how many children were there. It is a big family and even after dividing the entire country it was less. All the predecessor rulers who came they maintained the policies of Royal family. When King Faisal was there, which you won&rsquo;t remember but two signs of his are present in Pakistan; one is the King Faisal mosque which he donated and the city of Faisalabad where he invested a lot and was renamed in his name. He was a very powerful ruler of Saudi Arabia but he maintained the family rulership by distributing the authorities. Then Khalid came, then Fahd and then Abdullah came. Abdullah also inherited the same family principles and ruled according to that involving the entire family in power and wealth. But the current ruler Salman is the most accursed in this family as such everyone in this family is accursed but Salman even when he was not in power; Salman was the most accursed. He was the one supporting the religious group and was the pioneer of Takfirism. When he was the governor of Riyadh from that time he had these thoughts to have zero tolerance aginst Shias. Abdullah was a politician and to a certain extent he was known as a liberal ruler in Ale Saud. He was not believing and acting on many religious thoughts. Hence during his rulership Iran and Saudi had friendly relationships. He came to Iran as well and Rafsanjani went to Saudi Arab during his tenure. This was because of his liberal thinking. Salman was against him even at that time.</p>\r\n<p>The current ruler in a way is expired and retired. He has a sickness of Alzheimer which in Pakistani references we can say of Load shedding. In this sickness for some moment the mind of a person switches off for some moments. He forgets everything during that moment and then with medicines he recovers. Hence practically the ruler is his son and he is only a demonstration and for signing documents. His son, Mohammad bin Salman is a world seeker and highly immature, insane and foolish. If such a fool gets power, authority, wealth he turns out to be the most dangerous person. His weaknesses are known to others like America and Israel. They have selected him only and now this kingdom has come out of the family state into an individual rulership.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Transformation from family to individual emperorship</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Now Ale Saud are not the rulers it is Mohammed bin Salman; one member of this family who is the ruler and he has deprived everyone else from the family. He has taken power, wealth from them. He has arrested, punished some; some are killed, some are besieged some inside home, hotels and some of them who were outside the country are not returning and Mohammed bin Salman has seized all their assets. He has closed down their companies, bank accounts and taken everything under his control. The family is no more a part of the rulership.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/3_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="256" />This is not the outcome of his personal thoughts; these are being dictated to him by the American Satan&rsquo;s. The emperorship is of different faces; one is family, second is delegated and third is individualistic. The worst emperorship is this individual one whereby even his family is not included in this. They are going towards that governance which was not experienced before. Neither the people are acquainted there and nor was the structure present there. In order to make this new structure they have to bring down the old structure and to some extent that is done but more has to happen. He will do more blood shedding and extremism on his family members now. The politics which he has adopted in the political science is known as <strong>Spider Politics</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>In spider politics a web is made to trap others but the spider dies by getting trapped in the same web. Every spider gets trapped in its web which it makes to trap other insects. The spider web which he has made is that he has taken steps simultaneously outside the country and inside country as well he has started many foolish things.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Economic reformation from rental state to western welfare state</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One is in the name of reformatory actions he has transformed the rental state. Rental state is where the people are given one part of government share not as a compensation for doing something but instead they are given to remain unconcerned with the politics and government. They should just enjoy and not interfere in any state affairs. All Arab states where these Sheikhs are ruling like Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, Oman and Emirates are rental states. The states sell the national wealth like oil and they distribute some part of earning amongst people as rights for remaining silent. You have to remain unconcerned from state affairs and monthly compensations are given with free electricity, oil, tickets for foreign travel and these people don&rsquo;t do any work. This is the rental state and in these rental states the people only live on free income from state and they don&rsquo;t do any work for the country. If you see in these countries you will see all Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan who do everything. The local Arabs only enjoy their lives and without any hardships they get earnings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now when you change the structure of this system and bring them to a state where the people have to work, drive cars, do labor and then they are given salary and from that salary as well tax is deducted. In welfare states the government does not give anything to the people, they give opportunity to people for working and then they pay salary to people and from that they remove tax and run the nation. In an economic reformation without any study and preparation of ground he is trying to change the rental state to welfare state by an order. How is it possible that those who were eating free come to work in a day, take salary and from that salary pay forty percent as tax as well to government? This is the economic politics which he has started to create a western style state which has no possibility there.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Commanding a dream force of thirty four Muslim nations</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>On the other hand he has taken this step of creating a force of thirty four nation&rsquo;s alliance and he will command that force. This is also among those foolish acts. He issued a command, neither did he visit those countries; but just written their names that this is the force. He will give monthly Rials and some accepted that like this Pakistan General who left his country and became a slave of this filthy prince. What could be more disgrace which Allah could give someone? He was the number one of Pakistani force and now he is a slave of this filthy prince. America made a NATO which has become difficult to maintain and has broken. Turkey has come out of this and EU has made their own NATO; they have got the law of European defense force and America and Canada will not be part of it.&nbsp; America was not able to manage NATO and this crazy prince will manage this force by just issuing commands.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Aggression on Yemen</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The moment he came into power he started aggression on Yemen to demonstrate his power. He purchased new weapons and in the history of weapons sale Saudi has purchased the maximum and whatever Europe and America made they have purchased all. Now they attacked Yemen and that too with the help of Rials. He attacked Yemen tribe who don&rsquo;t even have proper dress to cover their body and no footwear. Yemen was a poor nation and they attacked it but still he could not win the battle since three years with these tribal people; that too with such big weapons. Now it has reversed when Yemen has launched Scud missile on Riyadh Airport. This has changed the game. When a missile is hitting Riyadh airport this means none of the Saudi points are secure. They replied that Iran has hit this and Trump also said I have seen that Iran has done this.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Conflict with Qatar</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>He was in need of global support to resolve Yemen crisis but instead he went into opposition with Qatar. He got few countries with him and he made his own arm of Qatar as his enemy. This was one more step of this spider politics.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Interference in Politics of Lebanon &ndash; Saad Hariri&rsquo;s forced resignation</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Now the most laughing step he has taken is interference in Lebanon politics. He called the Lebanese Prime Minister, arrested him and made him resign in Riyadh. Saad Hariri was invited and he told him to resign and he also did that under pressure. This is a unique incident in the world that the Prime Minister of one country is giving resignation sitting in another country. He should have resigned inside Lebanon but he has done this in Saudi Arabia and now he is not ready even to return to Lebanon. They are trying to play this gamble in Lebanon as well. By using his childish mind he has done this planning. In Syria; America, Europe, Saudi, Turkey all got brutally bashed by Iran. They got bashed by that country whose borders are also not touching Syria. They got bashed in a disgraceful manner. In Syria, Iraq the bashing which Iran has done to these nations which in village example is when a donkey passes into the field of a farmer, the way that donkey is bashed with batons, sticks to the extent that the donkey is made to run beaten to its owners house. Iran has done the same thing with their donkey in Syria, Iraq and made it bleed running to the doors of the owner and the owner realized that it&rsquo;s not their donkey but it they themselves who have been badly bashed. Now both Trump and Mohammed bin Salman want to take revenge from Iran and they are getting crazy about this. They have put this much capital in Syria, Iraq and made ISIS force but they have beaten us so badly and why can&rsquo;t they control Iran. Trump is trying to put more sanctions to control Iran and this Spiderman Mohammed bin Salman has been sent out to tackle Iran. He has been beaten by Iran in Syria and in Lebanon he wants to beat Iran.</p>\r\n<p>You should know about Lebanon that it is a unique country in the world in context of its political structure, strategic importance and many other aspects. There are three big populations, communities residing in Lebanon. They are Christians, Sunnis and Shias; there is a fourth small community of Druze as well whose leader is Walid Jumblatt but since they are small they affiliate with any of these three. Due to this distribution the situation of Lebanon has been disturbed since long and has been unstable. As per the censuses done in 1932 the Christians were majority, then Sunnis and then Shias. It was at that time but there is a difference in this distribution hence current precise figures are not there. The effect of this distribution was on the politics and the power positions have been distributed based on this. The President has to be Christian, the Prime Minister Sunni and the head of Parliament will be Shia. It is like this only now whereby Michel Aoun is the Christian President. He was head of Christian militia during the 80&rsquo;s and they had heavy battles with Hezbollah and Michelle Aoun was defeated and for a long time he escaped to France then returned back. At that time they were staunch enemies to Hezbollah. But now Michelle Aoun is the President, Saad Hariri the son of Rafiq Hariri who was assassinated in car bomb blast is the Prime Minister. Nabih Berry is the commander of Amal movement and is now the head of Parliament. They were all armed battle groups. Lebanon is divided in these three populations and even geographically they live separately inside Lebanon.</p>\r\n<p>The entire affairs of Lebanon are under control of three countries. France is effective and influential on the Christian population of Lebanon. The second is Saudi Arabia which is effective on Sunni and Iran on Shias. These three countries are effective, influential on their communities inside Lebanon. The battles that took place inside Lebanon historically were first between Christians and Shias; then Sunni, Shias and then even within Shias where Nabih Berry Amal militia were fighting with Hezbollah. Then Shia, Sunni fought with Christians. We can also say that there is a fifth community in big numbers present inside Lebanon; they are the Palestinian refugees in camps which are like colonies but known as camps and they are under Abbas Mahmoud control.</p>\r\n<p>As an outcome of these battles that weakest population which was Shias before these battles; the Christians were the most powerful, then Sunnis but during these battles even though the Shias were beaten badly but they became very powerful. At this moment there is only one decisive power in Lebanon and that is Shias and that too Hezbollah. There are two political groups of Shias; one is Amal party and Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a force and very powerful in Lebanon. This is the reason that all groups remain coordinated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the arm of Iran hence in other words the decision position in Lebanon is Iran. The war in Syria was also for this reason to cut the route of Iran to support Hezbollah. They wanted to cut this supply line and make a Takfirist route but that donkey got beaten. Now they want to clash with Iran in Lebanon. Iran is very far geographically from Lebanon and there is Iraq and Syria in between.</p>\r\n<p>In Lebanon they created panic; the Sunni Prime Minister was called, arrested, asked to resign so that the government in Lebanon collapses. The reason for the resignation announced was that a plot to assassinate Saad Hariri was made by Iran and Hezbollah. They wanted to make this issue a global issue and take this issue to global organizations. During Rafiq Hariri&rsquo;s time Syria had high influence in Lebanon and Syrian army was formally present in Lebanon and they had control over entire Lebanon. To get this control of Syrian forces out they had made this plot to assassinate Rafiq Hariri and put the blame on Syria. Then an investigation was done by UN and they proved that Syria and Hezbollah did this. It was not Syria who did this but they put the blame on Syria. Saudi got a resolution passed out in UN that Syria should come out of Lebanon and if they do not come out then all nations under American leadership should attack Syria. Syria was forced to remove their forces out from Lebanon and when Syria got the forces back to Syria and then they created a rebellion inside Syria. This first experiment of theirs was successful whereby they first got Rafiq Hariri the father of Saad Hariri assassinated, then put the blame on Syria, threatened Syrian government and got Lebanon empty. Now when Syria was out they were certain that Lebanon will come under their control. But this did not happen, Hezbollah became more powerful despite of Syria out from there. Hezbollah was not participating in Lebanese Politics and they were only an armed force. But when Syria went out they started to participate in the politics to have a strong grip.</p>\r\n<p>Hezbollah came into power to confront Israel when Israel had totally controlled Beirut and it was Hezbollah who got them out from there. The actual target of Hezbollah is Israel and they are not concerned about internal affairs of Lebanon. If they leave Hezbollah on their own and not fiddle with them Hezbollah will not participate in elections. Hezbollah decided to participate into elections when they made this plan to finish Hezbollah. They wanted to pressurize Hezbollah, declare them as terrorist and finish them completely. Then Hezbollah started this act of getting into state politics at that time so that the government should not stab them from behind. As a consequence of this, they have made a similar plan to get Iran out from Lebanon. They got Saad Hariri to resign and declare that he has threat from Iran and Hezbollah. Then after this they will arouse the Christian and Sunni communities inside Lebanon due to which protests will start against Iran and Hezbollah inside Lebanon. The people of Lebanon will come out on street to defend their Prime Minister. Then after that UN will step inside to threaten Iran to come out of Lebanon, stop Hezbollah and if they don&rsquo;t do then all nations should unitedly attack Iran; the way did for Syria before.</p>\r\n<p>This was one other step of his spider politics but he got disgraced. That disgrace happened as he got the Prime Minister of Lebanon to resign, made him issue a statement but the Sunnis and Christian of Lebanon cursed Saudi Arabia that you have insulted us by arresting our Prime Minister and telling that he has threat. There is no threat to him and if he has to resign he should first come back. Michel Aoun has also said and Sunnis as well have expressed hatred towards Saudi Arabia. The pictures of Mohammed bin Salman which were present in Sunni areas of Lebanon were burnt and they blamed Saudi Arabia was sparking off war with Lebanon. Saudi will try to bomb Lebanon for supporting Sunnis and make the state of Lebanon same as Yemen.</p>\r\n<p>He has prepared Israel to attack Hezbollah. Then Iran will step in there to help Hezbollah and then from here these Arabs, America, West will all siege Iran in Lebanon and beat Iran there. But this spider got caught in its own web and the Lebanese people have expressed their hatred towards Ale Saud. They made this policy that Hezbollah will become passionate. The government will come down, cabinet will dissolve and there will be panic in Lebanon. Hezbollah did the opposite; they ensured government remains as it is, they expressed sympathy towards Saad Hariri. They said he is our Prime Minster and he should be released. Michelle Aoun has said that if within two days Saad Hariri is not released I will put up a case against Saudi Arabia in United Nations. Whatever they decide became opposite. Now what they should do so they found a middle way that Saad Hariri will leave Saudi but not return to Lebanon instead he will go to France. They have released this news and it is possible that he will go to France and then they will somehow try to confuse this matter.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Establishment of alliance with Israel </em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One more Spider politics they have done in Saudi Arabia is that the Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubair has written a formal letter to King Salman on behalf of Foreign Ministry that under the current situation we have only one way that is to establish formal relationship with Israel. The country that can give us salvation is the government of Israel and no one else can come to our help. His intention was that from Iran no one can give us salvation other than Israel. Yesterday the commander in chief of Israeli forces has given an interview to newspaper that since Saudi and Israel have common interests hence the time has come that both nations should join hands and make united force to confront Iran. Israel has become the most wild and fearful beast after the defeat of ISIS in Syria. I have said this before as well that the war in Syria is decisive. The one who win this battle that party will become decisive and effective in Middle East. That decision has been almost done, ISIS has been defeated in both Syria and Iraq. The battle has been won by Syria, Iraq, Hezbollah and Russia. The way the world war took place it was won by opposition of Germany that is France, Britain and their allies. They divided Germany later and many restrictions were imposed on Germany. Germany cannot make their force, they cannot make atomic powers though some of them Germany has resolved. The role which Germany has to play in UN they should get. In the region the decisive politics is of one who wins.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Attempts to diplomatically besiege Iran</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Mohammed bin Salman is raising the issue of Yemen a lot that Iran is interfering in Yemen and the missile attacks done from Yemen is done by Iran. This missile has created a big fear on Saudi Arabia. They have seen this and experienced in Syria that they beat very brutally. Hence neither Israel nor Saudi Arabia will try to fight the same way again but one atmosphere they are creating is to unite global countries, pass resolutions to control Iran from interfering in Arab countries. The noise that is going on is this and Mohammed bin Salman is trying his tactics now. At the same time he has taken foolish steps inside the country, he has done rebellion inside the family, he is changing the state of government, he is attacking Yemen, getting in confrontation with Iran and now this Spiderman has been told that you will be the record breaking emperor in Saudi history. In Saudi the emperorship comes at the age of 80 and then the king dies at 85 years. The time for rulership is only limited. He has been told that he is the first prince who will become ruler in young age and then he will rule for more than 60 years and will be the world record of longest emperorship. At present the record of longest rulership is of Queen Elizabeth who is in power since sixty years and his son has reached the age of seventy years but she is not dying. They are now saying that she will give up the position but she is fit. Mohammed bin Salman wants to break this record.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Reversal from Orthodox Islamic laws to Liberalism</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One more step he has taken is a reversal of many laws. Like he has declared the holiday for Eid Milad Nabi which was considered as prohibited to celebrate in Saudi Arabia. They considered celebrating the birth anniversary of personalities as a big sin but he has announced that on 12<sup>th</sup> Rabi ul Awwal will be nation holiday. He has announced that this country will be Liberal. He has given permission for women to visit sports stadium. There will be teams of women.</p>\r\n<p>On one side he is transforming family rulership to himself and on other hand he is making the government as liberal so that Western support remains with him. He is doing everthing with a foolishness. He has arrested effective persons from inside the country into prison. He is breaking all the orthodox customs in the country. He is fueling fire against Iran. He has created this kind of atmosphere getting Middle East into a state of uncertainty. It is evident that when such foolish steps are taken these are signs that the time for eradication of this accursed family has come. Allah will give salvation to the entire Muslim Ummah from this accursed family soon.</p>\r\n<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>', 'Y', 'N', '', '', '1512484072Political_Analysis_of_the_Week_-_17th_Nov_2017.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-11 23:23:11', 'N'),
(39, '2017-11-24', 2, '167', 'Phenomenon of sit in protests in Islamabad', 'Phenomenon of sit in protests in Islamabad', 'phenomenon-of-sit-in-protests-in-islamabad', NULL, '<p><strong>Phenomenon of sit in protests in Islamabad</strong></p>\r\n<p>The disturbances are ongoing from before but when a new crisis takes place in Pakistan they forget the old issues and minds get entangled in new issues. Last week some bitter incidents took place which were grievous whereby three believers were martyred by terrorists in D.I. Khan and then in order to stop this the Pakistan army carried out an operation and in that operation a Pakistani army Major was killed. To this extent is Pakistan insecure and this entire nation is insecure for believers to the extent that even the Pakistani forces are not secure that an Army Major gets killed by the terrorists. Similarly one martyrdom took place in Karachi. We pray for the forgiveness of these martyrs and we seek patience from Allah for the family of these deceased.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/image1.png" alt="" width="277" height="165" />The second incident which is under process in Pakistan is the protest in Islamabad by one group. This is a unique thing of sit in protests that has started in Pakistan. It has been almost 17 to 18 days whereby the protestors are sitting on the Islamabad and Rawalpindi Junction and have blocked the motorway. The government has become helpless in front of them. The sit in protest is about a matter whereby few weeks before some alterations were done in the Election candidates form document related to the Seal of Prophethood (Khatme Nabuwat). Some ministry or authority made a new bill for every new election. In the past it was written that I swear and now it was changed to I confess. On this matter issue was made that with this change a conspiracy has been done whereby it was claimed that the Seal of Prophethood has come under threat and movements started to secure that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Parliament accepted the mistake and rectified it to the original statement but still this protest is ongoing. They are asking to bring out the criminals, victims, punish them and hand them over to them. This is known as non-issue and without any reason a crisis is being created and this face has been given. In reality the atmosphere that has been created in Pakistan and the elements, groups that have been formed in Pakistan this is all going to happen and will remain. Those who are thinking that this will change are simple minded because the way this has all changed its face the effects of this will be like this only. Since there are only few months left for the election coming up next year. The government has been a victim of crisis already; the Prime Minister has been suspended and declared as ineligible. The government is under pressure and the ground is being prepared for the next election. The political parties are making alliances for the elections. MMA (Muttahida Majlis e Amal) is again trying to revive itself. Certain religious groups which are highly extremist, prejudicial have made alliances with secular groups. The extremists have done alliance with secular groups. The party with which Jamaat e Islami had done alliance in last election now an extremist has taken the place of Jamaat e Islami to do alliance with the secular group. Sami ul Haqq group who are the hosts, supporters, guardians of extremism and are known as father of Taliban, Mujahideen and they have done alliance with Tahreek-e-Insaaf. In such situations at the time of elections both secularism as well as religious extremism become dubious</p>\r\n<p>MMA was made at the time of Parvez Musharraf and they established government as well in border areas. They were Parvez Musharraf&rsquo;s strengthening group and were known as the B team of Parvez Musharraf.&nbsp; Parvez Musharraf became the President by one vote and that was given by them. On the outward they were in opposition but inside they were his companions and for the sake of power they were willing to do everything. The only difference between secular and religious groups is about tool. One has secularism as a tool with them and other has religion as a tool. Neither they are secular nor they are religious and they both don&rsquo;t have faith on their schools. They both have faith only on power, personal gains, wealth, positions, posts and these things. They have faith only to get power whether it comes from fighting with each other or support each other whichever way. This is the political formula of Pakistan that in order to gain power everything is permissible. You can make sacredness also as a tool, means and with secularism you can make even non sanctitous things as means like nationalism, masses or religion</p>\r\n<p>At present there is anxiety on this sit in protest because this is an unacceptable phenomenon which people are trying to understand as to what will come out with this phenomenon. This group that is doing protests in Islamabad and plan to spread across Pakistan are Barelvi Ahle Sunnah. Ahmad Raza is the follower of Barelvi sect. In Pakistan a major categorization if we do in Ahle Sunnah then there are four major Sunni sects. One are the Barelvi Sunnis who believe in celebrating the Birth Anniversary of Prophet, recited eulogies, going to shrines, graves of Saints etc. Against them are Deobandi who consider all these acts of remembering Prophets and certain elderly personalities as forbidden. The third group is Ahle Hadith who are mostly Salafi. In Deobandi also there are various branches like political, extremist and seminaries. Then the fourth ones are Sufism and sages; though they have their own identity like Qadri, Chishti but are still closer to Barelvi; we can even say they are the same.</p>\r\n<p>At present those who are protesting against government and have stepped inside politics is the Barelvi group which is seen in Pakistan as a new Political power. Prior to this Deobandi Sunnis were in politics in full flow like the party of Fazalur Rehman; Jameatul Ulama e Islam whose guides are Sami ul Haqq. Ahle Hadith were also involved in politics before but Barelvi prior to this were not participating in politics this way. But now they have jumped into politics in a full fledge way. But their style, slogans, leadership, statements are highly dubious. They are sitting in the protests with sticks, batons; they have paralyzed two cities but Police is not having the courage to get them out. The government has this opinion that they have been made to sit intentionally, provoke the police and then police would force them to get up, then there will be conflicts between police and protestors; blood will spill and this blood would be used to create a wave of protests across the country and this way the 2018 elections will get insured from now itself as to who will win and lose. If the government shoots bullets on them then the party to which the current government belongs to will get highly condemned with the help of media and they will lose elections. This is the common view which they are giving and government, media are taking it in this perspective.</p>\r\n<p>The way of Sit in protests has become very common and every sect, group wants to use this method of sit in protests to get their stance accepted. The government, state rulership is a big power which can only be challenged with people&rsquo;s power which can paralyze the state. But the power stemming out from parties, groups, classes cannot stand for long. People can confront state but not the parties. But in Pakistan this has become a trend that you can try to get something accepted by the state with the sit in protests. The sit in protests are not done on the issues which are orally proclaimed instead behind the scene issues are something else. The actual issue between the protestors and the opponent against whom protests are done is somewhere else. In order to keep the opposition under pressure for that issue this politics of sit in protests is done. Since in these protests; parties, groups, organizations get involved and it can even reach a dangerous level which has happened in the past on several occasions. We can even say that this can even end up into a form of civil war specifically with the political instability prevailing in the state and this can impact every street in the country. An Internal civil war is a very bad war whereby the people get divided into groups and they fight, kill each other in every street and home. Such type of protests and reactionary actions can lead into that direction and its end cannot be predictive. Those who use these protests as a mean for their political interests are doing foolishness and in this protest politics is not at all in favor of nation. They want to give no importance to other nation, laws, constitution and just want to sit in for protests and get their stand accepted. If the issue is related to constitution then resolve it through law and court. Anyway these are all preparations for elections and its effects are coming on everything and if this adopts an extremist form then severe affects would be seen on ordinary people and will become the basis of more difficulties for Pakistan.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132461401512645509Sits.jpg', '', '1512536742Phenomenon_of_sit_in_protests_in_Islamabad.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:09:00', 'Y');

As such we Pakistani only know Zimbabwe in context of Cricket team but don&rsquo;t know where that country is. Zimbabwe is in the southern part of Africa and is in the neighbor of South Africa (the last southern edge country of Africa). Since last few weeks Zimbabwe is in the news headlines. The reason behind is that the Zimbabwe President; Robert Mugabe who is the ruler of Zimbabwe since forty years and has won the election seventh time to come into power got ousted from Presidency. His personality, politics is unique in entire Africa. Robert Mugabe has been made to resign at the age of ninety three years from Presidency due to a military coup against him. Due this coup he has been forced to leave the rulership at the age of ninety three. This person is an icon of anti-imperialism movement in Africa. He has played a significant role in the movement to get freedom for Zimbabwe from Britain and then also in the politics of Zimbabwe.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/robert.png" alt="" width="235" height="222" />Certain parts of Africa are rich and some parts are poor but the Africa towards the South which is surrounded by water from three sides is a rich area. It has oil, gas and mines of minerals, gold and diamonds. The lands are highly fertile, beautiful place and cultivated. In this part of Africa there is a big population of white skinned persons though Africa is dominated by Blacks. The white skins over here means Western people and not just British. All persons with white skins are not English. These white skins persons in big numbers have settled in Africa. When West became insecure with Hitler starting war and entire Europe was almost ruined then at the time when these people were starving and in pursuit of security they migrated to South Africa. Their numbers increased and they started to rule over the locals there. They made an atmosphere of racism which&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp;&nbsp; confronted&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; movement&nbsp; of Nelson Mandela who finished the government of whites and made a united or black government. Nelson Mandela is an icon aginst racism, communism in Africa but he is not an opponent of Imperialism.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Mugabe is a communal person and he keeps the foundation on African communism. He is against the white skinned, Britain, America and Imperialism. Robert Mugabe is that person who had a vision about the downtrodden and backwardness of Africa. Africa which is rich, fertile land but most of the people live under poverty, oppression and are deprived of basic necessities of life. I also got the opportunity to see one or two places in Africa also though they were not that poor but certain nations in Africa are highly downtrodden. Robert Mugabe believes the cause for all the backwardness, lowliness of African is due to Western People and it is true. All the wealth that is present in Africa is looted by West. France is deeply involved in many African countries and still certain countries of Africa are completely under France even now. Similarly certain areas are under Britain, Italy and above all these is America. The locals are their slaves and still the worst form of slavery is in Africa. These mines whose wealth is being looted by the West has all locals as labors.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/robert-1.png" alt="" width="260" height="173" />In the neighborhood of Zimbabwe are Namibia, Zambia, Botswana who are all rich and they have highly valuable mines. The whites and even Arabs specifically Lebanese are settled there. Robert Mugabe freedom for his country from these people of West and then after that he got the lands also out from them. All the lands, farms, mines which were captured by West he took from them and gave it to Blacks. This way Mugabe become an icon of resistance against white skinned persons globally. The Western world together boycotted Zimbabwe in a cruel manner. Their currency is the most invaluable in the world. This way they destroyed them and despite of this this person remained firm against them. He got elected as the President seven times and around two times he was the Prime Minister. They have besieged him since long and there was high pressure on Mugabe and they wanted to end him because he has become an example for other African nations, who might get impressed with him and tread in the same direction of confronting Western interests in the region.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence with pressure running over half a century they have pursued him to resign under a military coup. As such he is ninety three and a person of this age as such is not capable of running a government. At this stage for most of the people organs fail, they are not able either listen, see but this person is a wonder that at ninety three years he is running a government and eventually they had to remove him with the help of forces. Though there was no bloodshed but he was removed under a military coup. Mugabe will forever remain an icon in Africa. Mandela got more protocols because he was not Anti Imperialism; he was only an opponent of racism. He was not in opposition of West and more than African the West has given him more importance but Mugabe is hated by West. The West say that Mugabe is a devil. This was a very important incident that took place but the media has not taken this matter the way it deserved because the media is also slave. Hence it makes no difference for them if an icon of resistance falls down. They become happy on this. The way the President of Cuba, Fidel Castro was also an icon against Imperialism; Mugabe is also a similar icon. Such kind of personalities are not liked by West. Mugabe ideologically was a communist, socialist but a supporter of African community.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132461881512645581Mugabe.jpg', '', '1512537276Robert_Mugabe_–_Icon_of_Anti_Imperialism.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-24 04:03:49', 'Y'),

This insane, foolish Mohammad bin Salman who is dreaming about become an emperor of modern Saudi Arabia arrested several members of Saudi Royal family and punished them. It was there in the news today that he hanged them upside down inside<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/downfall.png" alt="" width="270" height="200" /> the hotel in which he had besieged them. There were more than five hundred most effective persons from Royal family related to trade, business, and army, politics who were arrested and put inside jail. It was there in news that he has called American private Security force Black Water. Black water has been involved in Yemen; Iraq and for some time they were present in Pakistan as well. They are a more dreadful agency then ISIS whereby disgraced criminals are taken, trained and their attires, make ups are made dreadful and like a Hollywood film they carry out operations. Mohammad bin Salman has taken the services of Blackwater for torturing the princes who he arrested. They as a first step have made the Princes hang upside down in Hotel and this is the beginning and God willing very soon Mohammad bin Salman will also be hanging upside down in the same place. This is the beginning of the end of this accursed family which has started from inside. The way I said last week that all the Spider politics which he made have all failed. Both Trump and Mohammad bin Salman are haunted by Iran. They don&rsquo;t talk about anything else other than Iran. They even scare their wives from Iran and their people, Arab world and the entire world that Iran is very dangerous. Bin Salman like a film cartoon has stepped in the ground who gets disgraced. You would have seen a cartoon by the name Pink Panther. Though that animal is very powerful but in that cartoon it is shown as very timid, weak and disgraced. This is a pink colored Leopard but most of the times get beaten by mouse, cat, fly and always gets humiliated. Bin Salman is a similar Pink Panther.</p>\r\n<p>This Arab NATO which he has made has a conference few days from now. He has started military drills along with Pakistan and this is the preparation he is doing against Iran. He has made this Arab NATO in which only few countries have practically got involved and rest all he has paid money and kept them under alliance. He is trying to take all steps aginst Iran.</p>\r\n<p>One step he has taken against Iran is in Lebanon. Since Lebanon is a strong base of Iran and hence in order to bash Iran in Lebanon through Israel he played this conspiracy. He made Saad Hariri to resign so that a crisis gets created in Lebanon and protests would start in Lebanon, which will be confronted by Hezbollah, Iran and then Israel will step inside and deal with Iran. But all this went against him and Saad Hariri himself has now gone against them. He has taken back his resignation and has met the Lebanese President. This card of bin Salman failed. He went after Qatar to isolate it; but it became more strong and closer to Iran though it has been always against Iran. He broke the Arab league also and now Oman., Qatar are openly against him. He called a gathering of Arab league and only the nominees of Bahrain, Saudi Araba yelled on Iran and rest nothing happened. Whatever step he took went against him and got disgraced. Now he is calling a conference on 26<sup>th</sup> for the Arab NATO in which Defense representatives of these nations will participate to make a war policy. These are his step which the entire world is attentive towards and are a sign that this family will get wiped off soon. People are now waiting for reactions from inside Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabi extremists, member of Royal family are all present in Saudi Arabia and the entire atmosphere of Saudi Arabia is under state of shock.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a question as to why no reaction has been seen till now? Neither the religious group spoke out, nor anyone from royal family, nor people or any other group. The Media is giving this impression that this silence is because of acceptance of Mohammad bin Salman by everyone. Media is telling that people are happy that this person has come for growth and prosperity of Saudi Arabia. This is not true. The reason is that Saudi Arabia and similar states are rental states which gives compensations to their people for reaming silent. They have made their people useless. There is no leader, opposition and nothing other than Royal family. Even the Royal family did not expect that a day will come when they will be hanged upside down. There are countries in which there are groups, oppositions which show immediate reaction if something happens from state. But in Saudi they were never prepared for this. Now they have started to think and do preparations and it takes time in such nations where there is no leader, opposition, media and no freedom. It takes time for different powers to ally and show reactions. There will be definite reactions from inside and outside Saudi also the foolishness which he is doing might end him before time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Iran has as such openly said that we don&rsquo;t want this battle with Ale Saudi on any land. This is a wise politics that this war should not take place as it is highly destructive. But a time comes when war is imposed the way Saddam imposed then it has to be fought. It is certain that the first day of this war would be the last day for Ale Saud. This is amongst established fact. We can see the war ability of Ale Saud from Yemen. They are fighting in Yemen with supersonic warfare and in Yemen the weakest&nbsp; people are there and in these years they could not even capture an inch from Yemen though they have ruined Yemen and in fact Yemenis have gone inside Saudi. Now the Yemenis are launching missiles inside Saudi. Hence when you cannot fight with the poorest people of Yemen living in deserts, barefoot then you are getting into a confrontation with such a powerful nation which has all war machinery. It is just a matter of yesterday that they have bashed you brutally in Iraq and Syria. They have rubbed your nose on ground and you are planning to fight with them? This is a foolishness and this happens when someone is in rush for his own destruction.

It is not the end of ISIS but the areas on which ISIS had occupancy in Syria and Iraq has ended. The last area in Syria which was under ISIS control has also been taken back. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/end.png" alt="" width="259" height="195" />ISIS is still there and some people got this misunderstanding that ISIS has been finished. ISIS is there but their occupation has ended. There is no area on Iraqi land which is under ISIS control. In Pakistan also ISIS is present almost everywhere like Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, KPK but hidden and they will carry out guerilla operations. First what they did was that they occupied a big area of Syria and Iraq this occupation has been ended. ISIS is there but weak and does not possess that power which they had before. There were several reason behind their weakening. One reason was Russia coming in opposition to them; second reason was Turkey getting away from them. Turkey did a foolishness and they had a disgraceful role in formation of ISIS. When turkey saw its internal situation worsening, they even did a foolishness of bringing down Russian warplane then they had to forcibly repent and from the time Turkey stopped supporting ISIS they started to become weak. And the final stroke which ISIS got was from Hezbollah, Iran and those defenders of Haram, those martyrs. May Allah bless these martyrs, grant patience to their families who did this great work that they purified two nations from the filthy ISIS existence.</p>\r\n<p>They are still remaining in a weak form and most of their fighters are killed. The policy of Hezbollah and those confronting ISIS did not had the policy of arresting them; instead their policy was to kill them. A big number amongst them have been killed, some escaped specifically from West; the Arab ISIS are still remaining and they are being moved to Afghanistan to take advantage from them in future. The second aspect of this is that it was not just ISIS which was present in Syria; there were other groups as well there who are still present and they still have some areas under their control. One such group is Jibhat ul Nusra , the Nusra Front which is a pure Takfirist group made by Saudi Arabia and supported by America. Then there is Syrian Liberation Army which is supported by America and they also have big areas under their control. Similarly there is a Kurd liberation army who are also supported by America and they also have a big area under their control. We have got freedom from ISIS occupancy but the other groups are still present. These other groups in majority are local Syrians. What happened now was decisive and Syrian army, Hezbollah, Iran have come under dominance and decisive position in Syria. It is possible that there might not be a war with other groups but negotiations. It is possible that they might be involved in government or something given to them.</p>\r\n<p>At present complete freedom of Syria has not yet been achieved but ISIS has been ended. This is a big thing done by these crusaders, the leader who have saved the entire world from this big threat, the Sunnis, Shias have been protected. The war that would be decisive was the Syrian war and the one who wins this will dominate the entire Middle East region. At present the scale of Iran, Hezbollah is heavy but as the Supreme Leader said that Satan will not remain negligent they will do the mischief somewhere else; the way Bin Salman is doing the preparations. It is possible he might open some another front in some other country. They cannot do in Syria but apart from that they can do this somewhere else like Bahrain, Yemen or start some operations in some parts of Iran as they have got a brutal stroke and badly wounded. A wounded snake is more dangerous.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="Section2" style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<p>Iran by eradicating ISIS has insulted, humiliated Trump and ninety countries from Arabs, West, East and everywhere. There were more than fifty countries personnel in ISIS and other nations were supporting them, providing them means and even a country like Japan has given them war vehicles. Korea, Japan have all provided means to ISIS for trade purpose as they have nothing to do with the Ideology. The Japanese Minister was asked how come so many Japanese vehicles were seen with ISIS and they replied that we are not able to locate the reseller of these vehicles.<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/end-1.png" alt="" width="266" height="179" />&nbsp;This was a big stroke which Iran has given them. What has happened you can consider that along with an armed field war there is a psychological war as well and for this type of war this victory was decisive. The psychological war breaks the back and weakens the courage of all fronts. The moment the news of a defeat of this type comes the courage of the leaders, fighter, supporters, finances all break. When the candidate in election loses the election the supporters and voters break out except for Shia voters who are never lose courage &nbsp;and &nbsp;are &nbsp;always &nbsp;ready &nbsp;to &nbsp;vote &nbsp;because &nbsp;they consider defeat only as victory. This feeling is there everywhere when defeat is suffered then once again they start to gather forces with time. This is the grace of Allah that the way Allah has promised that Allah will give a small group success over big group has come true</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">ۗكَمْ مِنْ فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The believers should ascertain that this way Allah gives success to small group over big group. This has happened now in your era and you should at least now ascertain that the promises which Allah has given that he will give dominance to weak ones and small groups if they have faith on Allah&rsquo;s promise. Allah will support them and this is the beginning in the entire Islamic world. There are many claimants of fighting against terrorism but the most successful operation against Terrorism is this only whereby two countries that came under control of a dreadful terrorist group got freedom. How? Who got them freedom? Hashad us Shabi, Defenders of Haram did this. They were not regular army men instead just ordinary normal people who got up on the call of Leader and Marjaiyat; got freedom for their country. We should ascertain that the promise of Allah comes true in every era but the condition is that you should have faith on it. This can repeat on any land and this is the beginning of that promise which Allah has made for the entire land. Allah&rsquo;s promise is there for believers and the righteous servants that I will grant you Caliphate of this earth to you. God willing that day will come for sure and that nation will be fortunate who will prepare the grounds for it when the Savior will come who will end terrorism, Taghoot, arrogance, imperialism , tyranny, oppression from the entire globe and the standard of Wilayat will waive everywhere.</p>', 'Y', 'N', '15132463531512645656End.jpg', '', '1512537708End_of_ISIS_occupancy_in_Syria_and_Iraq.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-24 04:16:17', 'Y'),

After a break once again a wave of killings have started in Balochistan. Pakistan has been surrounded by difficulties since forty years and these problems are those which are created by Pakistan itself. The useless rulers, establishment has jumped themselves and entire country into this fire. Our rulers have gambled and they lost everything in that gamble. They started a gamble in Afghanistan, by getting deceived by the Satan&rsquo;s and for their personal gains and they lost everything in that gamble. The effects of that loss is coming out one after another. Sometimes terrorism, sectarianism, political instability, economic crisis and what is happening today in Balochistan is part of the same story.</p>\r\n<p>The tragedy of Balochistan is related to the new story which Pakistan has started by tying up with China and America does not like this. China and Pakistan are enemies of India as wellbeing their neighbors. India might not care much about Pakistan but for China they are concerned. China is a global power and also is becoming a super power and is trying to become dominant over other powers. They have the ability and the way their direction is they can reach there. As I said before in one lecture that the current Chinese President has started the third plan which is presented by him. First vision was by Mao who got freedom on China, then Ping came and made it an economic power and the current President has given a vision, political wisdom which has become a part of their constitution whereby he wants to make China a global superpower. It is confirmed for China that in the next decade China will be an absolute power. First china was not intervening into politics but now they are also becoming political.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/1_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" />America which was a superpower is becoming weak day by day and its downfall journey has started; its pillars are coming down. It will take some time for the rise of China and fall of America. It will take some time for this to happen but as it happens many countries will come under direct influence and Pakistan has already come under this now. This is because Pakistan is one of the part of the Chinese policy. In the China policy one of them is CPEC which is not acceptable to India and America. For this they have made a comprehensive policy which as per reports from News agency India has allocated 55 billion Indian rupees as budget to counter CPEC. They have the budget of 46 billion in Pakistan and theirs is 55 billion. In order to counter the Chinese move they are doing all this and the visit of Trump recently in the region was also for this purpose only. The countries in which China is having a strategy and plan, America has also a plan for the same countries and both are now in auction. Every country will not assess, calculate which plan is profitable from them. The plans that are made by China is difficult for America to counter in this region as these Asian countries will mostly move towards China only.</p>\r\n<p>Japan and China are longtime enemies like India and Pakistan. This is because China was under control of Japan for a long time and Japanese consider Chinese as disgraced, lowly community. They have a communal difference amongst them hence Japan in this region will remain as American representative. Even though they have one culture, religion but due to this enmity they will not come near. The extremism between China and Japan is very high; as the difference is ideological, cultural and hence they will not come close easily. Thus Japan will favor America only but other countries will most probably incline towards China.</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan has come under the influence of Chinese strategy and the elements of unforeseen incidents are being gathered inside Pakistan mainly in two areas; one Gilgit and second Balochistan. For these two areas India by the alliance of Israel, America wants to destabilize these two regions. One region is the beginning of CPEC where it starts from Gilgit and it ends in Balochistan. India has started to create tensions, pressure in both these regions. When both the starting and ending point becomes insecure then the importance of central region of Punjab, Sindh where CPEC will pass has no signifance. They are trying to create a plan of disturbance in such a manner that this CPEC plan of China turns out to be expensive for China and both Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>China has kept this condition before only that if there is security, peace in Pakistan then only CPEC will start. This plan is conditional to peace in Pakistan. The establishment has given them commitment that there will be peace, security on this CPEC route. From there they have plans to make these two start and end points instable. Balochistan was already prepared from beginning whereby armed tribes were present since long, much before the creation of Pakistan. They were battling tribes not under any government who were following their tribal heads. This area has a history of armed tribal combats. Gilgit Baltistan was not like that and the tribal system here was not like Balochistan. But they are trying to create insecurity even in Gilgit Baltistan to the extent possible. They want to start insecurity on religious grounds in Gilgit Baltistan because the religious element is stronger in Gilgit Baltistan then tribalism. They have started a new wave in Balochistan and a message is being given that there is no stability in Balochistan. From here attempts are made to keep Balochistan peaceful but it&rsquo;s not happening and this story will proceed further. India has clearly said this in international organization and given complaints that this is a disputable zone and CPEC should not pass from here. It is possible that India might with some influence even get some opinion in their favor from global organizations. They are not able to get a resolution passed because China also has a decisive position in global political organizations. Hence they are preparing for a brutal conflict in this region by America and India against china. Hence these killings in Balochistan is part of this plan of America and India.</p>\r\n<p>Second reason behind this is the election in 2018 in Pakistan. Though no one is sure whether elections will happen or not but Pakistanis are not concerned if it happens or not; they are concerned about preparations. A lot of preparation for elections has started and media creates this anxiety more.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132464821512708978Balochistan.jpg', '', '1512540981New_wave_of_attacks_in_Balochistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:14:43', 'Y'),

There will be a battle within them and this battle will influence Pakistan and then Iran.<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/2_2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="175" /> And this is being planned also for these two countries. At present 30 to 35 percent part of Afghanistan is under control of Taliban and not government. And the areas of government control ISIS is being populated as they are being moved from Syria, Iraq into Afghanistan. America is moving ISIS into Afghanistan and making them strong in Afghanistan. They will use the Arab wealth and most of the resources for ISIS will be from Afghanistan only but some are being moved by America by NATO and their own aircrafts to Afghanistan. Trump is making a justification of providing the needs of their forces present in Afghanistan and under its cover they are provisioning ISIS. On the other hand Taliban is there whereby Russia is getting more attentive towards them. The countries that are with Russia wants to support Afghan Taliban. Pakistan is also inclined and is supporting Afghani Taliban whereas India is supporting the Pakistani Taliban. These two groups are busy in strengthening Taliban whereas America is doing the same for ISIS. These two bulls will fight but not in Afghanistan; they will do that in Iran and Pakistan. Taliban will attack American interests and ISIS will attack Iranian interests using Afghanistan. A full preparation has been done and media either due to fear or some plan does not discusses this but Afghanistan has been prepared in a dreadful manner and upcoming events would be deadly. This has one relationship with China as well. It is evident when a group like ISIS gets developed in Afghanistan then this would be dangerous for China as well. China will also support Taliban because that will be the shield for protection from ISIS. The extremist thinking people of Pakistan also wants to strengthen Afghan Taliban preserving them for this future conflict. It is clear that this would be destruction for Afghanistan as well whether it is ISIS or Taliban because both are the branches of same devilish tree of Takfirism. Their first target will be Shias only whether in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132465951512646085Afghanistan.jpg', '', '1512541153Afghanistan_being_prepared_for_ISIS.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-24 04:27:44', 'Y'),

Whatever is happening in Saudi are all in a dramatic way since last two or three years. In fact from the time Salman became the King and his accursed son Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince Saudi has changed its policies dramatically. Saudi had already worsened their situation but these two; father and son have deviated from the conventional Saudi politics and adopted a new political way. Until now Saudi had family rule and it was always Ale Saud which as a family was ruling the country even though king was one person but they have divided the country amongst family members. The wealth, oil, politics and all affairs of the state was under family and they were not giving any authority to anyone outside the family unless it became a must. Everything was exclusive to this family and the family as such is also very big. The host of this family had twenty one wives so you can imagine how many children were there. It is a big family and even after dividing the entire country it was less. All the predecessor rulers who came they maintained the policies of Royal family. When King Faisal was there, which you won&rsquo;t remember but two signs of his are present in Pakistan; one is the King Faisal mosque which he donated and the city of Faisalabad where he invested a lot and was renamed in his name. He was a very powerful ruler of Saudi Arabia but he maintained the family rulership by distributing the authorities. Then Khalid came, then Fahd and then Abdullah came. Abdullah also inherited the same family principles and ruled according to that involving the entire family in power and wealth. But the current ruler Salman is the most accursed in this family as such everyone in this family is accursed but Salman even when he was not in power; Salman was the most accursed. He was the one supporting the religious group and was the pioneer of Takfirism. When he was the governor of Riyadh from that time he had these thoughts to have zero tolerance aginst Shias. Abdullah was a politician and to a certain extent he was known as a liberal ruler in Ale Saud. He was not believing and acting on many religious thoughts. Hence during his rulership Iran and Saudi had friendly relationships. He came to Iran as well and Rafsanjani went to Saudi Arab during his tenure. This was because of his liberal thinking. Salman was against him even at that time.</p>\r\n<p>The current ruler in a way is expired and retired. He has a sickness of Alzheimer which in Pakistani references we can say of Load shedding. In this sickness for some moment the mind of a person switches off for some moments. He forgets everything during that moment and then with medicines he recovers. Hence practically the ruler is his son and he is only a demonstration and for signing documents. His son, Mohammad bin Salman is a world seeker and highly immature, insane and foolish. If such a fool gets power, authority, wealth he turns out to be the most dangerous person. His weaknesses are known to others like America and Israel. They have selected him only and now this kingdom has come out of the family state into an individual rulership.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Transformation from family to individual emperorship</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Now Ale Saud are not the rulers it is Mohammed bin Salman; one member of this family who is the ruler and he has deprived everyone else from the family. He has taken power, wealth from them. He has arrested, punished some; some are killed, some are besieged some inside home, hotels and some of them who were outside the country are not returning and Mohammed bin Salman has seized all their assets. He has closed down their companies, bank accounts and taken everything under his control. The family is no more a part of the rulership.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://avportal.testersweb.com/matabbooks/uploaded/3_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="256" />This is not the outcome of his personal thoughts; these are being dictated to him by the American Satan&rsquo;s. The emperorship is of different faces; one is family, second is delegated and third is individualistic. The worst emperorship is this individual one whereby even his family is not included in this. They are going towards that governance which was not experienced before. Neither the people are acquainted there and nor was the structure present there. In order to make this new structure they have to bring down the old structure and to some extent that is done but more has to happen. He will do more blood shedding and extremism on his family members now. The politics which he has adopted in the political science is known as <strong>Spider Politics</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>In spider politics a web is made to trap others but the spider dies by getting trapped in the same web. Every spider gets trapped in its web which it makes to trap other insects. The spider web which he has made is that he has taken steps simultaneously outside the country and inside country as well he has started many foolish things.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Economic reformation from rental state to western welfare state</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One is in the name of reformatory actions he has transformed the rental state. Rental state is where the people are given one part of government share not as a compensation for doing something but instead they are given to remain unconcerned with the politics and government. They should just enjoy and not interfere in any state affairs. All Arab states where these Sheikhs are ruling like Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, Oman and Emirates are rental states. The states sell the national wealth like oil and they distribute some part of earning amongst people as rights for remaining silent. You have to remain unconcerned from state affairs and monthly compensations are given with free electricity, oil, tickets for foreign travel and these people don&rsquo;t do any work. This is the rental state and in these rental states the people only live on free income from state and they don&rsquo;t do any work for the country. If you see in these countries you will see all Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan who do everything. The local Arabs only enjoy their lives and without any hardships they get earnings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now when you change the structure of this system and bring them to a state where the people have to work, drive cars, do labor and then they are given salary and from that salary as well tax is deducted. In welfare states the government does not give anything to the people, they give opportunity to people for working and then they pay salary to people and from that they remove tax and run the nation. In an economic reformation without any study and preparation of ground he is trying to change the rental state to welfare state by an order. How is it possible that those who were eating free come to work in a day, take salary and from that salary pay forty percent as tax as well to government? This is the economic politics which he has started to create a western style state which has no possibility there.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Commanding a dream force of thirty four Muslim nations</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>On the other hand he has taken this step of creating a force of thirty four nation&rsquo;s alliance and he will command that force. This is also among those foolish acts. He issued a command, neither did he visit those countries; but just written their names that this is the force. He will give monthly Rials and some accepted that like this Pakistan General who left his country and became a slave of this filthy prince. What could be more disgrace which Allah could give someone? He was the number one of Pakistani force and now he is a slave of this filthy prince. America made a NATO which has become difficult to maintain and has broken. Turkey has come out of this and EU has made their own NATO; they have got the law of European defense force and America and Canada will not be part of it.&nbsp; America was not able to manage NATO and this crazy prince will manage this force by just issuing commands.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Aggression on Yemen</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The moment he came into power he started aggression on Yemen to demonstrate his power. He purchased new weapons and in the history of weapons sale Saudi has purchased the maximum and whatever Europe and America made they have purchased all. Now they attacked Yemen and that too with the help of Rials. He attacked Yemen tribe who don&rsquo;t even have proper dress to cover their body and no footwear. Yemen was a poor nation and they attacked it but still he could not win the battle since three years with these tribal people; that too with such big weapons. Now it has reversed when Yemen has launched Scud missile on Riyadh Airport. This has changed the game. When a missile is hitting Riyadh airport this means none of the Saudi points are secure. They replied that Iran has hit this and Trump also said I have seen that Iran has done this.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Conflict with Qatar</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>He was in need of global support to resolve Yemen crisis but instead he went into opposition with Qatar. He got few countries with him and he made his own arm of Qatar as his enemy. This was one more step of this spider politics.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Interference in Politics of Lebanon &ndash; Saad Hariri&rsquo;s forced resignation</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Now the most laughing step he has taken is interference in Lebanon politics. He called the Lebanese Prime Minister, arrested him and made him resign in Riyadh. Saad Hariri was invited and he told him to resign and he also did that under pressure. This is a unique incident in the world that the Prime Minister of one country is giving resignation sitting in another country. He should have resigned inside Lebanon but he has done this in Saudi Arabia and now he is not ready even to return to Lebanon. They are trying to play this gamble in Lebanon as well. By using his childish mind he has done this planning. In Syria; America, Europe, Saudi, Turkey all got brutally bashed by Iran. They got bashed by that country whose borders are also not touching Syria. They got bashed in a disgraceful manner. In Syria, Iraq the bashing which Iran has done to these nations which in village example is when a donkey passes into the field of a farmer, the way that donkey is bashed with batons, sticks to the extent that the donkey is made to run beaten to its owners house. Iran has done the same thing with their donkey in Syria, Iraq and made it bleed running to the doors of the owner and the owner realized that it&rsquo;s not their donkey but it they themselves who have been badly bashed. Now both Trump and Mohammed bin Salman want to take revenge from Iran and they are getting crazy about this. They have put this much capital in Syria, Iraq and made ISIS force but they have beaten us so badly and why can&rsquo;t they control Iran. Trump is trying to put more sanctions to control Iran and this Spiderman Mohammed bin Salman has been sent out to tackle Iran. He has been beaten by Iran in Syria and in Lebanon he wants to beat Iran.</p>\r\n<p>You should know about Lebanon that it is a unique country in the world in context of its political structure, strategic importance and many other aspects. There are three big populations, communities residing in Lebanon. They are Christians, Sunnis and Shias; there is a fourth small community of Druze as well whose leader is Walid Jumblatt but since they are small they affiliate with any of these three. Due to this distribution the situation of Lebanon has been disturbed since long and has been unstable. As per the censuses done in 1932 the Christians were majority, then Sunnis and then Shias. It was at that time but there is a difference in this distribution hence current precise figures are not there. The effect of this distribution was on the politics and the power positions have been distributed based on this. The President has to be Christian, the Prime Minister Sunni and the head of Parliament will be Shia. It is like this only now whereby Michel Aoun is the Christian President. He was head of Christian militia during the 80&rsquo;s and they had heavy battles with Hezbollah and Michelle Aoun was defeated and for a long time he escaped to France then returned back. At that time they were staunch enemies to Hezbollah. But now Michelle Aoun is the President, Saad Hariri the son of Rafiq Hariri who was assassinated in car bomb blast is the Prime Minister. Nabih Berry is the commander of Amal movement and is now the head of Parliament. They were all armed battle groups. Lebanon is divided in these three populations and even geographically they live separately inside Lebanon.</p>\r\n<p>The entire affairs of Lebanon are under control of three countries. France is effective and influential on the Christian population of Lebanon. The second is Saudi Arabia which is effective on Sunni and Iran on Shias. These three countries are effective, influential on their communities inside Lebanon. The battles that took place inside Lebanon historically were first between Christians and Shias; then Sunni, Shias and then even within Shias where Nabih Berry Amal militia were fighting with Hezbollah. Then Shia, Sunni fought with Christians. We can also say that there is a fifth community in big numbers present inside Lebanon; they are the Palestinian refugees in camps which are like colonies but known as camps and they are under Abbas Mahmoud control.</p>\r\n<p>As an outcome of these battles that weakest population which was Shias before these battles; the Christians were the most powerful, then Sunnis but during these battles even though the Shias were beaten badly but they became very powerful. At this moment there is only one decisive power in Lebanon and that is Shias and that too Hezbollah. There are two political groups of Shias; one is Amal party and Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a force and very powerful in Lebanon. This is the reason that all groups remain coordinated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the arm of Iran hence in other words the decision position in Lebanon is Iran. The war in Syria was also for this reason to cut the route of Iran to support Hezbollah. They wanted to cut this supply line and make a Takfirist route but that donkey got beaten. Now they want to clash with Iran in Lebanon. Iran is very far geographically from Lebanon and there is Iraq and Syria in between.</p>\r\n<p>In Lebanon they created panic; the Sunni Prime Minister was called, arrested, asked to resign so that the government in Lebanon collapses. The reason for the resignation announced was that a plot to assassinate Saad Hariri was made by Iran and Hezbollah. They wanted to make this issue a global issue and take this issue to global organizations. During Rafiq Hariri&rsquo;s time Syria had high influence in Lebanon and Syrian army was formally present in Lebanon and they had control over entire Lebanon. To get this control of Syrian forces out they had made this plot to assassinate Rafiq Hariri and put the blame on Syria. Then an investigation was done by UN and they proved that Syria and Hezbollah did this. It was not Syria who did this but they put the blame on Syria. Saudi got a resolution passed out in UN that Syria should come out of Lebanon and if they do not come out then all nations under American leadership should attack Syria. Syria was forced to remove their forces out from Lebanon and when Syria got the forces back to Syria and then they created a rebellion inside Syria. This first experiment of theirs was successful whereby they first got Rafiq Hariri the father of Saad Hariri assassinated, then put the blame on Syria, threatened Syrian government and got Lebanon empty. Now when Syria was out they were certain that Lebanon will come under their control. But this did not happen, Hezbollah became more powerful despite of Syria out from there. Hezbollah was not participating in Lebanese Politics and they were only an armed force. But when Syria went out they started to participate in the politics to have a strong grip.</p>\r\n<p>Hezbollah came into power to confront Israel when Israel had totally controlled Beirut and it was Hezbollah who got them out from there. The actual target of Hezbollah is Israel and they are not concerned about internal affairs of Lebanon. If they leave Hezbollah on their own and not fiddle with them Hezbollah will not participate in elections. Hezbollah decided to participate into elections when they made this plan to finish Hezbollah. They wanted to pressurize Hezbollah, declare them as terrorist and finish them completely. Then Hezbollah started this act of getting into state politics at that time so that the government should not stab them from behind. As a consequence of this, they have made a similar plan to get Iran out from Lebanon. They got Saad Hariri to resign and declare that he has threat from Iran and Hezbollah. Then after this they will arouse the Christian and Sunni communities inside Lebanon due to which protests will start against Iran and Hezbollah inside Lebanon. The people of Lebanon will come out on street to defend their Prime Minister. Then after that UN will step inside to threaten Iran to come out of Lebanon, stop Hezbollah and if they don&rsquo;t do then all nations should unitedly attack Iran; the way did for Syria before.</p>\r\n<p>This was one other step of his spider politics but he got disgraced. That disgrace happened as he got the Prime Minister of Lebanon to resign, made him issue a statement but the Sunnis and Christian of Lebanon cursed Saudi Arabia that you have insulted us by arresting our Prime Minister and telling that he has threat. There is no threat to him and if he has to resign he should first come back. Michel Aoun has also said and Sunnis as well have expressed hatred towards Saudi Arabia. The pictures of Mohammed bin Salman which were present in Sunni areas of Lebanon were burnt and they blamed Saudi Arabia was sparking off war with Lebanon. Saudi will try to bomb Lebanon for supporting Sunnis and make the state of Lebanon same as Yemen.</p>\r\n<p>He has prepared Israel to attack Hezbollah. Then Iran will step in there to help Hezbollah and then from here these Arabs, America, West will all siege Iran in Lebanon and beat Iran there. But this spider got caught in its own web and the Lebanese people have expressed their hatred towards Ale Saud. They made this policy that Hezbollah will become passionate. The government will come down, cabinet will dissolve and there will be panic in Lebanon. Hezbollah did the opposite; they ensured government remains as it is, they expressed sympathy towards Saad Hariri. They said he is our Prime Minster and he should be released. Michelle Aoun has said that if within two days Saad Hariri is not released I will put up a case against Saudi Arabia in United Nations. Whatever they decide became opposite. Now what they should do so they found a middle way that Saad Hariri will leave Saudi but not return to Lebanon instead he will go to France. They have released this news and it is possible that he will go to France and then they will somehow try to confuse this matter.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Establishment of alliance with Israel </em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One more Spider politics they have done in Saudi Arabia is that the Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubair has written a formal letter to King Salman on behalf of Foreign Ministry that under the current situation we have only one way that is to establish formal relationship with Israel. The country that can give us salvation is the government of Israel and no one else can come to our help. His intention was that from Iran no one can give us salvation other than Israel. Yesterday the commander in chief of Israeli forces has given an interview to newspaper that since Saudi and Israel have common interests hence the time has come that both nations should join hands and make united force to confront Iran. Israel has become the most wild and fearful beast after the defeat of ISIS in Syria. I have said this before as well that the war in Syria is decisive. The one who win this battle that party will become decisive and effective in Middle East. That decision has been almost done, ISIS has been defeated in both Syria and Iraq. The battle has been won by Syria, Iraq, Hezbollah and Russia. The way the world war took place it was won by opposition of Germany that is France, Britain and their allies. They divided Germany later and many restrictions were imposed on Germany. Germany cannot make their force, they cannot make atomic powers though some of them Germany has resolved. The role which Germany has to play in UN they should get. In the region the decisive politics is of one who wins.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Attempts to diplomatically besiege Iran</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Mohammed bin Salman is raising the issue of Yemen a lot that Iran is interfering in Yemen and the missile attacks done from Yemen is done by Iran. This missile has created a big fear on Saudi Arabia. They have seen this and experienced in Syria that they beat very brutally. Hence neither Israel nor Saudi Arabia will try to fight the same way again but one atmosphere they are creating is to unite global countries, pass resolutions to control Iran from interfering in Arab countries. The noise that is going on is this and Mohammed bin Salman is trying his tactics now. At the same time he has taken foolish steps inside the country, he has done rebellion inside the family, he is changing the state of government, he is attacking Yemen, getting in confrontation with Iran and now this Spiderman has been told that you will be the record breaking emperor in Saudi history. In Saudi the emperorship comes at the age of 80 and then the king dies at 85 years. The time for rulership is only limited. He has been told that he is the first prince who will become ruler in young age and then he will rule for more than 60 years and will be the world record of longest emperorship. At present the record of longest rulership is of Queen Elizabeth who is in power since sixty years and his son has reached the age of seventy years but she is not dying. They are now saying that she will give up the position but she is fit. Mohammed bin Salman wants to break this record.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Reversal from Orthodox Islamic laws to Liberalism</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One more step he has taken is a reversal of many laws. Like he has declared the holiday for Eid Milad Nabi which was considered as prohibited to celebrate in Saudi Arabia. They considered celebrating the birth anniversary of personalities as a big sin but he has announced that on 12<sup>th</sup> Rabi ul Awwal will be nation holiday. He has announced that this country will be Liberal. He has given permission for women to visit sports stadium. There will be teams of women.</p>\r\n<p>On one side he is transforming family rulership to himself and on other hand he is making the government as liberal so that Western support remains with him. He is doing everthing with a foolishness. He has arrested effective persons from inside the country into prison. He is breaking all the orthodox customs in the country. He is fueling fire against Iran. He has created this kind of atmosphere getting Middle East into a state of uncertainty. It is evident that when such foolish steps are taken these are signs that the time for eradication of this accursed family has come. Allah will give salvation to the entire Muslim Ummah from this accursed family soon.</p>\r\n<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132467231512645895Spiderman.jpg', '', '1512541499Nine_insane_steps_of_Mohammad_Bin_Salman.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:18:43', 'Y'),

In national issues they are there from beginning only in Pakistan but time and again new waves starts which is due to the political stability going on since long and internal pressures from all direction; then foreign interference, then behind the veils many elements which have affected everything in the country. Inflation is increasing like a beast and it is evident that when there is political instability then it will affect the economy as well. There will be black marketing, looting, chaos, panic and that is what is happening here due to political instability.</p>\r\n<p>There is political instability and then on top of that non serious media. The way this dreadful media takes up these issues it makes it worst and severe. Whatever type of media you see they are all busy in spoiling and destroying everything may it be printed media, TV, social media and all other forms are ruining. In such situations many damages are happening but people are not aware as well. It is like a patient inflicted with many diseases but he is not aware, no medicine then what is happening inside his body is not known to anyone outside. The nations are also like this. If a country becomes a victim of instability for a day then just do accountability of the level of losses that happen in a day are non-imaginable; if you see the figures they are scary. As an example there are certain countries in which the power cuts are not there even for a moment. At times due to some accident this incident happen and power cuts off. We have seen in recent years; that is if there is no power for one hour in a country like America or Canada, then by evening they come up with figures as to the financial losses that took place due to that one hour; as to how many transactions did not take place, payments were not transferred, how many contracts, deal were not done etc. In that one hour billions of dollars are lost due to one hour of no electricity. They present these figures and is written if you see the figures of those incidents in history. Since there is no electricity in Pakistan then does that mean there is no loss? The entire foundation and infrastructure has been destroyed due to lack of power. The Industrialization and its foundation are all ruined due to no electricity.</p>\r\n<p>This filthy General in the entire history of Pakistan, General Parvez Musharraf who was the topmost insensible, foolish person who thought that I understand everything. He himself in one of his interview on TV said that in my government itself Pakistan was completely bankrupted at that time only. He confessed in his interview but the global institutions and big powers who had relationship knew what the situation of our economy was but this was not announced and kept it inside. Then we took loans and took the system forward and this was an interview of few days back. The present Army chief has said few weeks back that the difficulty of Pakistan is not defense. They used to say before that Pakistan has threats from terrorism and neighbors. Few days&rsquo; back he has issued this statement that our economy is completely ruined and he gave example of Soviet Union that they did not broke out due to weapons but was due to economy. Soviet Union which got divided into some nations and it was a big empire which got divided because their economy was weak. Our army General is saying that we will not be defeated by weapons instead our economy will destroy us. The economy is not getting ruined it was already ruined. The damage which they have done inside the country no one points towards it; neither the rulers, politicians, parties nor media no one speaks on this topic of ruined economy of ours. The wrath of the destruction of economy does not comes on government, rulers instead it all comes on people and breaks the back of masses. But our Pakistani people are not concerned about anything if there is a cricket match. They do not care for hunger, thirst and can tolerate everything and they are doing. This is the effect of political instability which is not expressed. We don&rsquo;t have time here but this has to be analyzed as to which domains we are suffering to what level.</p>\r\n</div>', 'N', 'N', '15132468211512708823Ruined-Economy.jpg', '', '1512545996Ruined_economy_of_Pakistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-08-30 14:22:19', 'Y'),

The government institutions hijacks people and then do not inform also where they are. You are government organization and if someone has a crime, then you can inform the person of the crime, get arrest warrant from court and then arrest him and present in court, run trial , give him time to defend and if the crime is proven then punish him else release him. But this is not acted upon and multiple persons are picked up in abnormal way then neither their family, relatives nor anyone else knows about.</p>\r\n<p>One effect of such thing is on the international status and personality of the nation. The personality of Pakistan has become very bad and globally Pakistan is not trusted by anyone even by close friends of Pakistan because of these acts. You have law in the country and when there is law why you bypass it. The law has given the rights to arrest by police, court and person can be arrested by law but despite of law being present they hijack persons in such an unlawful manner. It is like a person has married legally and has a lawful wife and then the husband comes and kidnaps his wife from home. When you have law, she is your wife, you can take here anywhere but you come as a gang and kidnap your own wife would be a senseless act. Such things creates anxiety, fear amongst people and sense of insecurity. And on top of this there is defaming of nation and international trust is lost and as such Pakistan has lost its status globally then on top of this such activities are done. There is no doubt that those who do such things are not loyal to Pakistan. And specifically for Shias there has been a policy forever whereas everyone openly knows who the terrorist are; which groups, people, leaders are all known to everyone. They are doing this because if they only take steps against one group then it will be one sided hence you should target all groups. It is like there are bandits in one area and in order to catch them you arrest others also who are not bandits so that the bandits don&rsquo;t complain that you are only arresting us. What kind of logic is this? You are arresting a full village with innocents so that balance is maintained and to give this impression. Shias are the victim of this illogical thinking in Pakistan. Those who are a threat for the insecurity of Pakistan and have proven since years that they are not well-wishers of Pakistan and to arrest them they have made this justification to arrest others also. If they are criminals then arrest them and tell them for what crime you are arrested.

Since several years a very beautiful scene gets repeated every year and this year also it will happen this way. That scene is the gathering, a congregation of Shias coming to Karbala in millions. This is happening first time in history whereby Shias come out and present to the entire world their status and this gathering takes place at the shrine of Sayyadus Shohada. There are many secondary aspects but at a collective level this is an excellent gathering. The way it has its greatness there are equal dangers also because to the same extent enemies are annoyed from this. This is the fruit of Islamic revolution and every Bat should see this light. It is possible that many would be taking credits for it but everyone knows and should know that this is the outcome of only one thing that is the Islamic revolution and the movement of Imam Khomeini and the System of Wilayat. This should be recorded in the results of Islamic revolution that globally Shiite has reached that level of honor and dignity that they present their existence in front of the world. The same Shias who were hidden in Taqqayyahh (dissimulation) in various pockets of the world and were intentionally, voluntarily due to fear were not expressing themselves. The historical fear they had and on its basis the nations where majority were Shias like Iran, Iraq, and Bahrain were subjugated under governments. But now the same Shias are expressing their presence at a global level. This is the globalization of Shias and is amongst the objectives of Islamic Revolution of Imam Khomeini (r.a). This objective of Islamic Revolution which Imam (r.a) had to provide prestige, dignity and honor to Shias globally can be witnessed by the world globally. The world does not likes this scene because in order to prevent from this stage the satanic powers have tried all their efforts that this should not happen. In the same Iraq where millions of Shias are gathering there was a beast like Saddam planted to uproot Shias and that beast has done tyranny and has killed multiple believers. Then monstrous forces like ISIS was created to kill Shiite and even after all this if we see this grandeur of Shiite then all this is due to the means of one personality and incident that is Islamic revolution that Allah revived all this.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Today various persons like traders visit such big congregation; put up stalls, shops, sell products and draw benefits from this gathering. Then there are many industries which get benefit; transporters, travel agents all earn, then various airlines of the world run special flights not because of Shias but due to this business. There are many who put their pictures, stalls and take benefits. There are many who gain benefits for themselves as this is a big opportunity. There are many who consider this gathering as a big opportunity to spread misguidance as well. They spread their misguidance visions and all this happens, people are doing also. It is not that if someone hangs his picture also then it does not mean that this grandeur is due to that personality because it is clear as to from where Shiite has got this greatness. This discussion should be done repeatedly about the fruits, results and effects of Islamic Revolution globally. We should with awareness do analysis on this subject and this gathering is amongst one of these effects. Alhamdolillah gradually this gathering is getting in the right direction and Shiite is slowly coming in that direction of Wilayat. This congregation is getting into that direction and eventually its face will turn towards the System of Wilayat. But certain countries do not want this gathering to happen. The courtyard Mufti&rsquo;s of Ale Saud start to give Fatwas that this is Shirk, this gathering, visiting Shrines, Azadari is all Shirk. The nations and rulers try various conspiracies to do such things.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132469381512710502Arbaeen-3.jpg', '', '1512546177Arbaeen_congregation.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:22:18', 'Y'),

The Pakistani pilgrims when they go for Ziarat they get all the calamities, difficulties in Pakistan before the border. They face many difficulties in getting Visa, they become victims of travel agents, and then they are victimized by embassies and their agents. Then they suffer difficulties on the path, specifically those who go by road they are troubled severely. They are stopped in Quetta and there are various groups in which Shias, government, transporters are all involved to trouble them. Those belivers who are poor only they go by road who cannot afford to pay to go by air. They despite of threats, dangers they go out with limited money and then there is a Mafia in Quetta which loots them with every excuse up to Taftan. Then when they return to Taftan they are further tortured. This is done every year and now also news are coming; they are stopped with the excuse of security and then Mafia&rsquo;s coming to fetch money from all possible reasons. All this is happening because one reason is for this Haraam usurpers. The second reason is that due to these reasons they want to become effective on this gathering Arbaeen. This has started already in many Arab and other nations to create problems for the believers travelling so that their quantum reduces every year due to fear and difficulties. Amongst this one thing which the media, columnists and the enemies of Ahlulbayt, Pakistan, terrorists, their supports, preachers, name sake leaders spread an impression in Pakistan to stop this gathering.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The evil message which they spread is that these pilgrims go to Iraq to join the forces who are fighting against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. If this issue of ISIS in Iraq, Syria was to be solved through pilgrims then one Arbaeen was enough. If these twenty million pilgrims are made to walk as procession from Iraq to Syria then they can wipe off entire Middle East. These pilgrims are going for Ziarat but when they return they are investigated, their files are made, and they are interrogated as to why they went. They are being questioned as to who took you, whom did you meet there, why did you go there and these are filthy things which these agencies do with pilgrims. You want to stop people from Ziarat of Sayyadus Shohada with this harassment. Do you think you will stop people from this Ziarat? Has it ever stopped with these tactics? It is impossible to stop people from this. At the time of Saddam there was silence in Karbala and no one was there on Arbaeen. But see today there is no Saddam, his followers, they all went to hell and the followers of Sayyadus Shohada are doing Azadari there in a dignified manner. That time is not far when this system will be established across the world. Sayyadus Shohada is not a heritage just for Shias, he is for every human being. As per one Christian who has belief in Sayyadus Shohada as well but not as an Imam. He respects Sayyadus Shohada as a leader of freedom, one who fought as an oppression and considers Sayyadus Shohada as an icon of humanity. Wherever in the world any uprising that has taken place aginst oppression there has been an affiliation with Karbala. And this is going on and hence with this oppression on Shias which you have been doing has not finished Shias and neither will this happen. Imam Ali (a.s) says those who pass away safe from swords, battles spread more and there is vastness in their generation. The numbers which you kill there will be multiples born and the earth will be enlightened with them.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132469921512709425Maltreating.jpg', '', '1512546261Maltreating_of_Pakistani_Pilgrims_for_Ziarat.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:23:13', 'Y'),

The method which the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman has adopted inside Saudi Arabia is dramatic. He is a man from the movie world and he used to mostly watch Cartoons and was an expert on video games, and from there he prepared himself. In the upcoming future there are important things about to happen in Saudi Arabia inside as well as around it both politically and economically. This is because for the sake of securing their economy they have announced a new policy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class="Section2">\r\n<p>There is a British newspaper Guardian in which Mohammad bin Salman has given interview; there he has expressed that they are going to make Saudi Arabia a very modern state. Saudi Arabia wants to spend the money equivalent to what China wants to spend across more than twenty countries. Many consider these as political statements or some claims from a destroyed nation. This is true also when a dictator is about to die he talks such interesting things when he sees death. He has made imaginary forces and when death is near he talks such crazy things that go and capture China and do this, that. His family members listen to all this. This state of a person under downfall who talks about such things. Internally there is a unique division, hatred, malice developed amongst themselves. A big part of Royal family is in under prison. He has kept many of his family members, specifically of his age under house arrest and he lives under very high degree of security system to the level that he considers also as his enemy. This has happened before also when Shah Khalid was killed by member of his family. They have this threat and some from this family are big tyrants. Mohammed bin Salman has wiped off families from Royal family. Since news don&rsquo;t come out that much this dreadful things are about to happen in Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n<p>He has made a modern map for Saudi Arabia till 2030 with high level of modernization. There will be no Non Saudi working in Saudi and all Saudis will run their country. They will construct the nation not just from oil revenue but from tax and other sources. He has seen these golden dreams and when the rulers become victim of such dreams then the internal situation of the country becomes very interesting. This gives a clue to those who have insights that upcoming incidents in Saudi would be very interesting. One statement he has said in interview with Guardian that we are reverting back to the Saudi Arabia before 1979. In 1979 there was Islamic Revolution in Iran. He has openly said that from 1979 Saudi has adopted a wrong line and we went towards extremism. He said that the decision of extremism which we took at that time was correct because if we would not have done that then the Iranian revolution would have drowned Saudi Arabia. The biggest imperialist emperor in Middle East was Shah of Iran and they were the biggest superpower of Middle East. When this big emperor got uprooted then other small kingdoms shivered that now it would be their turn. Hence they selected this root of extremism to block the progress of Islamic revolution. They prepared Saddam to attack Iran, then supported them and finally they got disgraced through the hands of Saddam. According to confession of Mohammad bin Salman if we would not have done all this then our emperorship would have been gone from Saudi and this revolution of Khomeini would have drowned us. We adopted this policy at that time but now we are returning back to the policy of balance. The Western world has paid serious attention to this statement. He is doing this, as he is immature, raw person who is sitting with this internal situation and having plan to make Saudi Arabia as the most modern country in the world.</p>\r\n<p>In other words the most hard, conservative, orthodox, thoughtfully degraded country will become the worlds most modernized. He has given driving permission to women, he has given permission for women to come in stadium to watch football of men and they will play themselves as well. They have permitted Saudi songs, dance also on Saudi TV. There was an old Egyptian lady singer very famous whose song was broadcasted on Saudi TV. They are doing this day and night to modernize Saudi Arabia. This act of this Prince and the existing status of Saudi people, their thoughts, the other members of Royal family will all create a very interesting situation there. It is not that everyone is an obedient to this crown prince. Before issuing this statement he has imprisoned more than half of the members of Royal family. He has given this statement but now reactions will come from various sides. The semen of chaos, panic and has got laid in this country, these incidents will grow, become young and all this will happen very fast in Saudi Arab. The essence of these incidents, their thinking, steps is such that it will not take time. In a very short time these sincidents will take place. There are many sensitive things and many dimensions which needs to be clarified then we can understand this. I have just briefly expressed this point for our youths and people that Saudi Arabia has become a victim of some big upcoming events internally. Whatever external games Saudi had to play they had played but internally they are moving into an interesting situation. There is an effect of Saudi Arabia on the entire world whereby they have made groups, forces, organizations, Madrassahs in many places across the world. And Pakistan is the most affected land due to Saudi thinking.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Saudi has invested and put a lot of efforts in Pakistan. They have conferences every day in Pakistan. Our Pakistan government should be alert about this that if this chaos, panic takes place in Saudi then more effects will be on Pakistan then Saudi. These internal extremist forces which were made inside Pakistan by Saudi Arabia will now go to Saudi Arabia to intervene in their internal conflicts. This will have a serious effect on Pakistan. These were talks before but the practical steps have also started now, whereby they have besieged a big part of Royal family members. They have now started to move towards Scholars; they have taken away the status of many of their scholars, put restrictions on Fatwa and they have kept under house arrest their extremist scholars from whose thoughts ISIS was created. Trump and Israel are playing big role in this, they are very happy and giving statements every day that Arab world is with us and will be like us. If you gather all these statements then the Arab world is moving towards a dreadful situation. In Pakistan also the rulers, government and everyone should be attentive. When all these things start Shiite will be affected with us because the actual victim of Ale Saud is Shiite. Till day Ale Saud have only targeted Shiite and when they get themselves inflicted then Shias will again be targeted.

This is getting better every year and this year also as per estimates given more than 30 million pilgrims in form of Caravan, women, men, young, old, personalities and all are attending from various corners of the world. One unique thing about this gathering is that a big route is travelled by these pilgrims by walk without any vehicles from the shrine of Ameerul Momineen (a.s) in Najaf to the shrine of Imam Hussain (a.s) in Karbala. This was a culture since long and pilgrims would travel on various occasions but was very specific to Arbaeen. This in past was not known to others except the people of Najaf. This custom was initiated by some elderly scholars based on some traditions about walking to the shrine of Imam Hussain (a.s). Since last few years this congregation has acquired a different status and this is no more an ordinary custom as it has been expressed by the Supreme Leader (d.a) in his Arbaeen message.</p>\r\n<p>Two days backs in one of his Fiqh lectures the Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution; Ayatullah Khamenei (d.a) has said that this gathering has been created by Allah as a big bounty in this era and it has various dimensions around it which needs to be expressed and the entire Ummah needs to be attentive towards it. When 30 million people gather at one place that too specifically in this era which is an era of enmity against Muslims and that too specifically against Shiite. The entire world of infidels, hypocrites, Arabs, West and everyone have allied together to end this school of Shiite. This thinking they have not hidden and have clearly expressed at many instances. In their fresh expressions also they have said that we want to eradicate Shiite and with Shiite the humanity is endangered. The insane Arabs and specifically the accursed family of Ale Saud, which will be destroyed soon are the on the frontline, standard bearers and behind their back is the big devil, Taghoot America and their President who wants to crush Shiite.</p>\r\n<p>In such an atmosphere this event carries a big significance. As the Leader said that the hearts are not in the control of man, it is in Allah&rsquo;s control who can turn heart anywhere. Shiite if we see since few decades has risen being a lost school on the global horizon for centuries. The Western and far off communities were not even aware that a school with the name of Shias is also present. Shiite was recognized with the Islamic Revolution and movement of Imam Khomeini (r.a). The way it was introduced that people got pursued to identify, recognize Shiite and it was not possible to ignore them as Shiite came into headlines. Shias created their presence in the headlines and all this was due to the Islamic revolution of Imam Khomeini (r.a). This revolution was the mountain of Shiite in which there was a volcano and to control it from erupting and suppressing it entire world gathered for several times. They tried all tactics to turn off this light of revolution and this same Iraq was bought forward. Around thirty to thirty five countries joined hands to extinguish this light of Allah but they got disgraced and ended. There was a time when Iran was trying to protect, secure its revolution inside the borders of Iran. The revolution came out of that phase and the same Taghoots are afraid that this revolution has become a threat for their governments.</p>\r\n<p>In this situation the global appearance of Shiite and expression of its presence whose one symbolic act is this gathering of Arbaeen is unique. This not something normal that for a school of Shiite for which all power, efforts were used to suppress them but still they are expressing their presence in such a manner. In Iraq there are still graves found of thousands of Shias who became victim of atrocities of Saddam. The shadow of the horror of Saddam ended and immediately a more brutal, beastly tyrant of ISIS was placed upon Iraq. Now when ISIS became weak in Iraq they immediately created the Fitnah of Kurdistan so that the back of Iran can never become straight. The reason why they are sensitive now is that they were negligent at the time of Islamic Revolution in Iran and they did not took that revolution seriously because they considered the emperor of Iran as very powerful and against them are Mullahs, students of seminary which can do nothing. They got killed in this negligence and did not realize the strength of these Mullahs. When they saw that how powerful they were then they became serious and do not want to repeat the same mistake again. That is the reason they enforced atrocities in Iraq through tyrants like Saddam and now ISIS. The same situation is there in Bahrain where they have put extraordinary pressure on the people and then the oppression done by Ale Saud in Saudi Arabia. The tyranny was to the extent that Shia populated towns were completely wiped. In last few months they did this with Awamiya which was completely flattened by bulldozers. They martyred big numbers, arrested many and left many in scorching heat in tents. And now they are planning to make these places as centers of tourism so that Shias can run away from there. They want to remove Shias from the land and elope them from there and push them in other areas. If they want to live then they should live as labors in these place of corruption. This was their planning for various areas of Shias which is in progress in Pakistan and other places. This was their plan and I have said many times that they plan their stratagems but as per Quran Allah also plans his stratagem which is dominant over the plans of Satan. This gathering of Arbaeen is the divine plan for foiling the plans of Satan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132471381512647845Arbaeen-2.jpg', '', '1512551632Arbaeen_Congregation.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:25:38', 'Y'),

In fact most of them are passionate believers in Shiism and in this year&rsquo;s gathering a big number of Ahle Sunnah from various parts of the world have come as caravans and groups. There are various groups of people participating and majority as per the quality standards are just simple sentimental believers. But those who are giving direction to this congregation and has the reigns in their hand is the visionary group and revolutionaries and this is developing a big hope. As we know there are many Azadari programs that take place across the globe but those are not under the umbrella of scholars and Marjaiyat. Like in Pakistan there is Azadari in big way with full passion and sentiments but not under the umbrella of scholars and Marajae; it is some other group of traders, drug addicts, professionals on pulpits who want to cash Karbala are controlling this Azadari. But the gathering of Arbaeen is under the umbrella of Wilayat even though on the outward that is not seen and even the Supreme Leader (d.a) has said that his pictures should not be put up in this gathering under some wisdom. But whatever is happening with the grace of Allah is happening under Wilayat. This is the true act and any movement, mission, activity can only be termed as being correct if that is under the shadow of Wilayat. If it is not under Wilayat then there is no guarantee in which direction this movement will go and who will take what benefits from it. This Arbaeen congregation is under the shadow of Wilayat and it is due to the stratagem of Wilayat the ISIS have been eradicated in Syria and Iraq. Who has cut the roots of the enemies of Shias and Islam? It is not done by those who only reap materialistic and spiritual benefits from the sentiments and passions of people, those who make their own personality and demand respect from people; they have not uprooted ISIS. It is done through Wilayat and big sacrifices have been given for this and this would not have been happened without sacrifices. How a dreadful force like ISIS which shook governments got wiped off in front of the eyes of everyone cannot be precisely known now as these are secrets which over a period of time will get revealed. There are many secrets, codes inside this confrontation with ISIS and it is not necessary that these secrets should come out but over a period of time when it comes out people will know whose outcome it was. This global gathering of Arbaeen has become an identity for Shiite and a recognition of rising of Shia. It was not that the purpose of gathering and pinnacle of Shiite; which some people think also is to show the world that once in a year millions of Shias are gathering in one place. The thinking of hosts of Majlis, organization is this only to gather big number of persons to show off to the world how many people come to us. The purpose of this gathering was being awaited for centuries and after centuries, generations have been waiting for the system of justice to get established globally and this gathering is the beginning of that because those who were supposed to do this had abandoned themselves; were afraid, sitting in hiding and were considering themselves as weak and under state of Taqaiyya. Now those who were lost have come out with full power of appearance. This will not end because after this is the next step from which everyone is afraid. The enemies have themselves said that these people believe in Mahdaviat, reappearance of Imam (a.t.f.s), global governance of Imamat and hence they are dangerous and should be eradicated. This congregation should reach there and get connected with that movement and this standard has to go there.</p>\r\n<p>During this era the situations have to change in various countries. Hence do not think that this gathering is just a simple congregation where sentimental believers visit, gain some rewards (Thawaab) and return. As I mentioned that majority of those visiting are believers who only have faith on this matter. But those who have the reigns in their hands and under whose umbrella this gathering is being done they know very well where this gathering will head towards. Hence every country is afraid on the occasion of this gathering and are victim of strange panic. They have been trying to make all possible efforts to make this event a failure or weaken it but as I said this is their stratagem and Allah has his own stratagem which dominates over all the plans of Satan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As I said this gathering is under the banner of Wilayat but it constitutes of various faces. There is one group of caravan traders who have nothing to do with the essence of this pilgrimage. These caravan companies who take people for pilgrimage some of them visit Israel also. They have no concern as they are tourist companies and can take people anywhere. If you ask them to take you to Churches and temples they will do that as well. Similarly there are many other groups who visit for their own personal gains and they are not the ones who can change the direction of this gathering or cash this gathering for the right objectives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Y', 'N', '15132471871512647588Arbaeen.jpg', '', '1512551746Arbaeen_gathering_under_the_shadow_of_Wilayat.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-18 22:33:54', 'Y'),

The Shiite that has been made, nurtured, supervised by MI6 is present in every country and in every category. MI6 is the most ancient and cunning, Satanic Intelligence agency of the world and even CIA is a child of MI6. Though CIA has a bigger network but the aggression, difficulties which MI6 has done across the world for Muslims are grievous.</p>\r\n<p>In the current era the target of MI6 is Shiite and that too after Islamic Revolution when Shiite came out as a power. Shiite was forsaken, in hiding, not political and was not known to anyone. Shias were only seeking visas for pilgrimage, permits for Muharram processions and Shia did not believe to demand anything more than that. Today Shia is a claimant that the actual political system presented by Islam is with us and we are going to introduce that system to the world which is meant for salvation of humanity and is present with us. This is the claim of Shias and a big revolution in itself whereby the same Shias who were sitting underground, in cellars have come and risen above ground. The Shiite which was only indulged in basic customary things is now expressing global issues. This is an unordinary and highly esteemed revolution. I remember an elderly person who visited the sacred city of Qom for pilgrimage and he met some Pakistani students. He told us that I am astonished where these students are now and I remember those days when we used to sit with traditional scholars and type of topics they were discussing but now I am witnessing the intellectual levels from the topics these students talk and discuss. This is the growth in Shiite and they are claimant that they have an Ideology and presented their global system to the world. It is the Shias who have the one world order. Satan has presented their own world order whereas Mahdaviat is the world order of Shiite. The one global system in all domains may it be political, economic, industrial, education and everything presented by the Quran will be inherited by Shias and these global systems will be run by the Imams of Shia.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand we can see the last century that has passed in which an accursed lineage came into existence which casted its evil shadows on every Muslim and that is Ale Saud. In 1932 their government was formally established in Hejaz. In 1906 the MI6 British agency started the conspiracy to establish this accursed family over entire Arab world. Lawrence of Arabia; a British spy lived in this region for years and made a plan for Middle East. He was the nominee of the British Queen and worked as a spy in this region. He is well known personality and many stories, films are made on him. Every student of Islam should be aware and know what Lawrence of Arabia did. This was his design which he made for the Middle East and was made by this organization of MI6.</p>\r\n<p>And today also MI6 is not negligent from this big gathering of Shias and they have made full arrangements for the Shias. They have prepared persons at all levels even to the level of Marjaiyat to destroy Shiite. Imam Khomeini (r.a) delivered a message by the title &ldquo;Manshoor e Roohaniyat&rdquo; (Manifesto of Scholars) and in that he pointed out amongst the conspiracies which imperialists and enemies of Islam have done for Shias one of them is that they have prepared persons up to the level of Marjaiyat. They are doing this in full-fledged way and such persons, personalities are presenting the version of Shiite designed by MI6. It is evident that every scene of Shiite power is in their vision and they have devised a plan for it.</p>\r\n<p>It is impossible to think that they have not made any arrangement for Arbaeen. They have made good and expensive arrangement for this Arbaeen gathering and might be the hosts of this gathering have spent less for this gathering as compared to what MI6 has spent. They are nurturing persons of these levels in various countries and taking complete control of a big family like Shirazi and making global networks for them and persons who are ready to sell themselves have been bought up for this gathering. They are also aware about strength of this gathering and whichever direction this gathering turns Shiite will also move in the same direction. If this gathering moves under the shadow of Wilayat then globally Shiite will also move in that direction but if this gathering moves in the direction of MI6 Shiite and then God forbid the direction of global Shiite will also be in that direction. The eyes of MI6 are very sharp and deep on this gathering hence they have made big plans for this gathering so that they can turn the direction of Shiite towards themselves. And they want to use all this against the system of Wilayat.</p>\r\n<p>There are many evidences, proofs available for this but there is not much time here. In some other opportunity I will speak in more details as to what work MI6 has done in various centers. The Supreme Leader has been making everyone alert and attentive since long towards this infiltration. This infiltration is the biggest element of their conspiracy where they infiltrate and implant their trained persons within Shia organizations, parties, centers and around personalities. Then through them change the track of Shiite from the direction in which it has turned due to the Islamic Revolution of Imam Khomeini (r.a)</p>\r\n<p>Arbaeen as per the Supreme Leader is a great bounty of Allah which has been given to us in this era when big plans are made by the enemies and hence awareness is required towards this. The participants who are attending this gathering should do it with awareness that this group (of MI6) Shiite is also present in this. I will just present a simple example for this because these are not illusions and imagination. It is foolishness and simple mindedness to consider these facts as illusions. There are proper evidences of this available in your country itself as to where to turn the direction of this gathering they want to take. There is one audio clip which has been recorded by some believers about what is happening with the pilgrims of Arbaeen and then they broadcasted as to what is being said there.</p>\r\n<p>In Quetta there is a Shia organization whose head is a Shia Scholar and his son is Jawad Rafiee who is the deputy president of this organization. He has become the representative for all pilgrims and whomsoever he issues the permission letter only they are allowed to cross the Taftan border. The pilgrims from Punjab, Sindh, Gilgit and other areas when they reach Quetta in their office to get the Bus to reach border and government has made this arrangement. This person takes confession and pledges from pilgrims. At present also there is a big number of pilgrims sitting at the border who were not allowed to go for Arbaeen pilgrimage. Arbaeen has come and passed and these pilgrims are sitting at the border like captives. They are pleading, calling for help and certain times they have called us to see if we can do something. There are around 25,000 pilgrims in this state at Quetta who are not allowed to go forward. When these pilgrims visit their office this person Jawad Rafie is tak ing pledge from the pilgrims which you can listen to it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Audio clip being played </strong>&ldquo;they <em>visit the shrine of Imam Khomeini there; you pledge us in writing that when you visit Iran you will not visit the shrine of Imam Khomeini; I told them from when has he become our Imam, is our Imam not alive, you promise that you will not participate in Quds rally anytime.&rdquo;. </em>There are two voices; in one of them he is saying that when you visit Iran you will not go to the shrine of Imam Khomeini and give this in writing. This person Rafie is taking a pledge from pilgrims that you should not visit the shrine of Imam Khomeini (r.a). Second he is saying that you will never participate in Quds rally. He continues to talk and later he says that what you should do in the Arbaeen rally. The caravan leader is made to write all this and this person is a Shia and son of a scholar. You can see the planning of MI6 as to what plans and to what level they have planned for Arbaeen. They have stopped 25,000 pilgrims so as to reduce as much possible the numbers. And those who are going they are taking pledge that you should not visit the shrine of Imam Khomeini (r.a), not participate in Quds rally and then he says on Arbaeen which places, groups you should visit and which you should not. He is making the travel agent understand all this and taking pledge from him. This is what is happening in Pakistan and also similar in many other countries. Even in Iran during Arbaeen the Shirazi network has prepared groups to be sent to Iraq. The Shirazi network is the most dangerous and devilish MI6 group within Shias. They are very vast and they have a network in Arab nations, in Pakistan also their old time representatives are present who introduce them and are now also preparing for them.</p>\r\n<p>This dimension is also present in Arbaeen on which we have to be attentive and specifically the Pakistan nation who become very quickly a captive of Fitnah. They should be made aware about this. In many other places the Azadari is besieged by MI6. It is not that they will declare Azadari as forbidden but instead change its form so that it does not leads into the right direction so that it is damaging for Shiite and turn the face towards sectarianism. This is the MI6 plan to confront the system of Wilayat. In this esteemed congregation of Arbaeen where the promise of Allah is getting fulfilled and at times it takes generations for the promise of Allah to get fulfilled. Ashab-e-Kahaf was one generation and it took three hundred years for the promise of Allah to get fulfilled. If the nation would have been prepared this would have happened in three days.</p>\r\n<p>You should be attentive that since a century the devilish tree of Ale Saud which has burnt the Ummah and created the fire of discord. The oppression done by Banu Umayyah would be less then what Ale Saud has done. They have sowed the seed of discord, hatred amongst Muslims. This is also the conspiracy of Ale Saud and you can see in the face of Ale Saud what MI6 does. When they targeted Arabs they divided them and got such accursed families into power which you can see now. If they have targeted Shiite now the same thing they will do here as well as what they did on Arab lands.</p>\r\n<p>Ale Saud for a century after spreading hatred, malice and Shia Killing now they have announced that we are going to modernize Saudi Arabia. In 1979 we had a need to go towards extremism but now we want to revert back towards moderation. The ruler of Saudi Arabia has given an interview few weeks back in which he said we are reverting back to the state of Saudi Arabia to that before 1979. This was the official statement. On one side you can see Arbaeen and then on other hand you can see Ale Saud. They went on their peak and now today with their own hands they are going towards downfall. They have started the disgraceful journey of downfall. Whereas the Shiite whom they are targeted is heading towards it peak. This Arbaeen is a symbol of the power of Shiite gradually going upwards. This was the promise of Allah that those communities who were humiliated before we will make then honored whereas those who were honored before will become disgraced. This act has started now whereby Arbaeen is seen as a sign of rise of a school, Ideology and on other hand a devilish lineage has started towards a downfall.</p>\r\n<p>If you remember I said in last Friday sermon that very soon big changes will come in Saudi Arabia. On the very next day on Saturday this act started and more than five hundred corrupt prince from this corrupt family were arrested. The method they adopted that King Salman made a committee of Anti- Corruption and made his son as the head of this committee. Within two hours Mohammed bin Salman declared that these are all corrupt people who have usurped the national treasury and ten trillion dollars are present with them. He arrested these family princes in a seven star hotel where Trump also visited. This is the downfall of Saudi because at present for their survival and lust of power they are doing all this. If you want to target corruption then this entire lineage is corrupt; you should even dig graves and bring the corrupt ones out and disgrace them. This is because all your basis is on corruption. You have looted the capital of people and the wealth of oil, gas which you got you deprived your own people. You are all tyrants who fed public money to USA and west.</p>\r\n<p>This thirty three years old crown prince Mohammad bin Salman wants to make history and lead Saudi for fifty years. He has arrested big personalities from this accursed family and this way the Royal family is heading towards destruction. As I said that Saudi Arabia will become victim of these incidents but this happened much faster than expected. He has started to use force to besiege them but reaction will come from them also. The religious category has not gone into opposition; for now their Mufti has spoken in favor of these acts. But with the level of extremism present there in religious category anything can happen. And if something major happens then it will affect others also outside and Pakistan is the country that gets affected very fast. They might need to call forces from Pakistan. Prince Salman will call his force from Pakistan, his opposition will call theirs and the religious category will call theirs as all the three groups have their forces present in Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The act that has started in Saudi is in a way very strange way. He has made Saad Hariri as hostage. This has also happened first time in the world that the Prime minister of a country visits another nation is arrested and they ask him to give resignation. Now there is tension started in Lebanon. Saad Hariri was given a task to be done in Lebanon which he could not do, though he is their person only. And now Saudi Arabia and Emirates together are planning for some other Fitnah in Lebanon. Since they have been defeated in Syria, Iraq, Iran so now they want to start sedition in Lebanon. For this they have arrested Saad Hariri and also called his family there. This internal war is about to start in Lebanon for which there is global anxiety. Hezbollah and Iran have announced that we are attentive towards this Fitnah and God willing like before they will dissolve this sedition as well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia is doing one more planning since a most corrupt person Trump is with them. At present Trump is on a visit to China, South Korea and Japan to start a movement against North Korea. He wants to create a front against North Korea. To create a front against Iran he visited Saudi Arabia and gathered the Arab nations against Iran. He threatened them that Iran is very dangerous and we can protect you from the danger of Iran. They accepted the words of Trump and ready for steps against Iran.</p>\r\n<p>For Ale Saud there are two options; one is to come out in the field and give salvation to America from the threat of Iran. The second option is get away from power in a dreadful manner. During the era of Obama they have reached to this point. This foolish crown prince has adopted this path that I have to become a Hero and make Saudi at the global here. He wants to make entire Middle East as one nation under Saudi and all other existing nations will be its colonies and destroy Iran completely. Trump is doing operations against Iran and they are doing on their way.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Few days back Yemeni militia has targeted Riyadh Airport with a long range missile and it hit the target. Mohammad bin Salman says that this is announcement of battle from Iran. As I said before that Ale Saud has to fight a direct battle with Iran and for that Trump made Saudi Arabia as the depot of weapons. This Prince Salman made an alliance force of 40 countries on rent, then got the Pakistan General as its head. They are training their forces in Yemen and all this is being done for this day and with the alliance forces they are trying for a direct attack with Iran. Iran has always tried for this direct battle to not take place because there will be a big damage if this war happens. But on the other side this foolish prince has no other way left and he on the promise of Trump will start this battle that America will help him. On one hand he has made an Islamic NATO and on other hand he is sitting on the promise of Trump to get help and both will meet their objectives. This fool does not know that this would be an act of stupidity as this war will becomes the basis of destruction for entire region. The attack on Iran will not be like attack on Yemen. Iran is a power which has its own military machinery, weapons, an experienced force and people power. The forces of Iran have defeated them in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen and hence they know better how to fight on their own land. The leader has said in his speech addressing Saudi Arabia that you are doing mistakes; one is that you are considering us as your enemy and America as your friend and second you do not realize our power. This is correct that this insane person is not having the correct estimate of the power of Iran as to what all can happen. He is going to fight his war with rented forces and rented forces are like rented orators. They only fight for compensations and not fight for death. They also do not realize that in the past Iran had only one shoulder as Hezbollah but now they have another shoulder as Hashad us Shabi. In terms of number Hashad us Shabi is ten times bigger than Hezbollah. They are second Hezbollah in Iraq which has demolished ISIS then against them what you will do sitting in AC rooms. There is no benefit other than destruction of Muslim Ummah. Iran has tried all possible efforts to avoid direct confrontation but this foolish prince wants to move towards this fast. He has said that this scud missile attack is a direct interference of Iran in the war with Yemen and we will reply to this. They will not reply in Yemen but in Tehran. They might do some stupidity which will result into big losses but eventually this devilish tree will get destroyed. He will get destroyed due to the foolish steps he has taken into Saudi Arabia. What he has done inside Saudi was his act but now reactions will come out. Saudi Arabia was a police state in which no information comes out and there is no preparation for anything. In such places it takes some time for reaction. The royal family members, the religious category are under state of shock but eventually they will come out of this and show their reactions. Then the reply will be to either kill some of these or in order to control internal rifts Saudi might attack Iran as well which is also a possibility. The activity which he has done in Saudi Arabia where he has arrested a very powerful group and on the basis of Trumps support he is moving towards liberalism by which he is upsetting the religious category as well. There is one way to stop the internal rifts which is to start external war. For this they might attack Lebanon and on this Iran and Hezbollah will come out. This kind of foolishness Mohammed Salman wants to do on the devilish guidance of Trump. God willing before he creates more damages Allah would wipe this person and this accursed family completely.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class="Section2">\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class="Section3">\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132472291512646203Infiltration-Within-Shias.jpg', '', '1512551924MI6_Infiltration_within_Shias_and_Arbaeen_congregation.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-18 22:19:01', 'Y'),

It is evident when those governmental organizations who are running the country; they for the sake of power, personal interests clash with each other than nation, masses get forsaken. Then they tranquilize this in a very stupid manner. Whenever there is a political instability, they immediately arrange for a cricket match which soothes the community. It was there few days before that a musician&rsquo;s brain was to be operated. He could not be made unconscious due to some risks, so for his tranquility they played music so that he got involved and they operated him, this was outside Pakistan. For Pakistani community the cure for every pain is cricket. When cricket is announced it means deep wounds has been inflicted or about to be inflicted. They send their teams or bring some other team. It is easy to pamper non serious people. This instability is effective on everyone and similarly these days more anxiety is being created about economy. I have been always saying one point which has now come as a witness on the tongues of the government.</p>\r\n<p>I have said that that economy of Pakistan is destroyed to a dreadful level but no one discusses about this because no one cares for it. Their bank accounts, stomachs are full hence if the community economy is disturbed the rulers are not affected. Everything is to be suffered by the community, masses but this non serious community can be easily pampered. Eighteen hours power is not there but if cricket is going on the community will be pleased.</p>\r\n<p>At present everyone is ringing danger bell. The Chief of Pakistan army has pointed towards economy and openly said this for the first time. He gave example that Soviet Union; Russia was the biggest power in the world, in terms of geography. Soviet Union even after division is still a big nation. The Army Chief said that the reason for Soviet Union being broken was not lack of forces but it was for lack of economy. They have taken up this subject now that our economy has come to this level.</p>\r\n<p>The international finance groups have rang the danger bell and they have changed their policy towards Pakistan. Every country has an economic value and based on that global financial institutes gives them loans. It is for every individual or company like if you visit a shop to buy something and if you ask for credit, the shopkeepers give credit to some and not to others. This is based on the economic value of that person if he can pay back or not. If bank gives loan to someone they weigh his financial status. They don&rsquo;t see the titles, names of persons and not by name or lineage they give loans. Everyone has a financial status and trading is done based on the value of that entity. These global institutes have devalued Pakistan and India has a big role in this in pursuing these institutes. They have seen how much export Pakistan is doing, how much they are buying, trading and that decides the economic policy and then do valuation. The situation of Pakistan has become such that international firms cannot deal with them anymore. The value of Pakistan economy will come down further and this is a bad news for us.</p>\r\n<p>The reason for this are these politicians who are lavish people and in their lavishness they have got the nation inside the jaws of destruction. If some finance experts come and tell this to the community about what can happen and the upcoming days are destructive. In last few days the newspapers has published big conflicts between establishments and government. Whereby economy issue was raised for various purposes. But due to this raising of issue which government did not like this but due to this conflict certain things get exposed. This is because there is an effect, when the economic weakness of a country is exposed then foreign nations stop from investing in the country. At present only China is trying to support and do business in Pakistan but with this alarm others will stop.</p>\r\n<p>The Pakistani labor which is working in Gulf countries was a big economical support for Pakistan. It was a big dependency for Pakistan whereby this labor was working outside and sending money to their families and home which has a national economical affect. The second effect is from those friend countries of Pakistan which are these Arab countries. The American think tank has dictated a new plan to modernize Saudi Arabia and they have changed their economic policies whereby they want to remove the expats and replace them with their own people to save their economy. The first thing they did was to get rid of Pakistani, similarly they are getting rid of Pakistani from UAE. The Qataris who have rented half of our country for hunting. But they are not giving work visa to Pakistani. Now gradually they will come out. As per Saudi Arab by 2030 no expats will remain there. The sources of job, work in our country is getting destroyed. The outside sources are getting diminished. The credit that was taken from outside is not being returned and interests are going up. Globally Pakistan will be declared as bankrupt. As India has said we will isolate Pakistan completely, fist they did diplomatically and now economically. But till the time Cricket is there we are not worried. They are now paying big money to foreign teams to come and play here. If they can spend same money on a power plant but cricket is the cure, ointment for the wounds of this nation. This is a very dangerous form of terrorism. The life of common man will be very difficult due to the effects of this economic crisis</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="Section2">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132472691512711107Economic-Crisis.jpg', '', '1512553909Economic_Crisis_in_Pakistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:27:50', 'Y'),

There are issues from all regards for pilgrims especially from Quetta to the border there are big difficulties for believers. They go there and sit for weeks in Quetta and on border to send them securely. These transporters have become Mafia and take ransom from the people, disturb them and trouble them. They stop them in Quetta and on border, so that they can give ransom whatever they decide. Taftan is such a place where if you stop someone for a day also, people will be ready to give everything to come out. It is a dessert where there is nothing to eat, pray and for weeks the pilgrims are made to sit and trouble them, and then they will collect thousands from everyone so that they can be sent out. This is the mafia who takes advantage of Shia emotions. There are some Shias also involved in this who share their part. If we make demands from government that is useless. We have done rallies, protests on the streets this will not solve the issue. This government will not solve anything and they have never done. It is useless to demand from them. This work should be done by pilgrims and the leaders of caravan. They take so much money from people that they can make arrangements. There are organizations who beat the drums of community they don&rsquo;t solve any problem but earn for themselves in the name of pain for community. These organizations have funds as well. They should make a department whose duty is to keep the pilgrims secure, make arrangements for making them reach safely from Quetta to border. They should not leave them on the mercy of these Mafia.

Every three months that contract is reviewed and signed off but Trump has not signed this time and looks like that it will be terminated. In Iran also there is sensitivity and Leader has also given a very hard statement about American intentions and made the community attentive towards this.</p>\r\n<p>America has got the weakness of Iranians that they are afraid of sanctions and not afraid of bombs, wars, martyrdom. This weakness has been shown from inside Iran that through sanctions you can get everything accepted. The way leader has said earlier that this nuclear contract is not the final one. If you accept this, they will move forward. If they have stopped nuclear plan now they are asking to stop the missile system. Iran has become a very powerful missile power. North Korea, Pakistani, India, South Korea and Iran make powerful missiles in this region which can target across continent. The way America can fire long range missiles, the same technology is with Iran. They want to end this and more than this they want to end IRGC also. At present they are pushing this through Trump. But the dangerous part is that there are elements inside the government who are taking advantage of this situation. There are anti revolutionaries inside who are only afraid of IRGC which cannot be taken over by them. It is a big force of Iran which has defeated enemies everywhere. There are people inside the country as well who are annoyed with IRGC and many attempts are made. The President has also tried to make liberal approaches but IRGC comes in between. They say that IRGC is the powerful shoulder of Leader. America&rsquo;s actual objective is removing the Wilayat regime which can be only achieved by removing IRGC. Saudi has said that any cost of bringing down the Iranian regime will be paid by them. They knew that by fighting with IRGC they will not be successful, but by putting sanctions on Iran and IRGC they will put pressure on public and they want to achieve this. They have fought and seen that Iranians cannot be defeated. This force has fought for 8 yrs with Iraq, then outside also in Syria, Iraq they have defeated American brewed forces. So they now want to cut this shoulder of leader and they have planned this through their think tank. Their think tanks have told them that it is impossible to end the Islamic revolution and Islami governance in Iran unless IRGC is there.

The celebrations for the birth anniversary of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) were more but the programs for Unity have been less. The believers who like Islamic Unity are very less and similarly the scholars who like Islamic unity are found to be unique. In the era when the games of sectarianism are going on, in this atmosphere of animosity unity is seen to be colorless and rare. <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_5.JPG" alt="" width="279" height="150" />These are blessed days which brings a lot for believers. The greatest of all bounties in these days is the essence of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). The entire Ummah can gather around the personality of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and become one united Ummah. With one Allah, one Qiblah, One Quran present still the Muslims are not one. We have many things that are one but Muslims are not one. It was not a big thing that we could have been one, but even this small thing we did not like to do. In fact some are so insane that they are against unity, instead many in opposition to unity. The MI6 Shia are openly against Unity of Ummah and openly with the help of the media which they have created they do sacrilege of other Muslim sects. As such they do this sacrilege throughout the year but during these days they take this on its peak. &nbsp;They start this from 9<sup>th</sup> Rabi ul Awwal celebrations where they curse others and then take it to peak during these days. The Mi6 group, their scholars and supporters are not just disliking unity but instead are enemies of Unity and of all those who are promoters of Islamic Unity and curse them and try to inflict big blows on them.

I have explained the reasons before this; that the confrontation that has been going on against terrorism is only by shaking of this tree, branches where only leaves are falling but the roots are in its place. The leaves fall down and then again come up. It is not enough to only bring down the leaves. As said before there are three roots of terrorism whose open evidences are present and the Pakistani community are witnessing them openly. One root are those sects, schools of thought which declare every Muslim sect other than them as infidels and obligatory to kill. This thinking and sect is the biggest root of terrorism and in the battle against terrorism they are not touched at all. In fact for the sake of getting their votes for elections all political parties, those in power and those not have all remained away from them. They are in fact supporting this group just for the sake of getting votes. The supporters of this Takfirist groups are present in every lane of Pakistan and since these are all votes the political parties don&rsquo;t touch them and in fact they are doing alliance with them. Recently a secular party has done compromise and alliance with the father of these Takfirist thinking group and have done an election alliance from now itself. The person who in media has been called as the father of terrorism. The secular group which is not even religious for the sake of votes have done political alliance. It is not just that they don&rsquo;t touch them but instead they help, support and give them aid. First they gave 300 million Rupees to them as gift and now they have done alliance with them. Who says that we are confronting against terrorism. That vision according to which all Muslims are infidels; they were and are allowed to spread, propagate and there is no control on them. They come openly in media and declare by name Shias and other schools that they are all infidels and obligatory too kill. Now all these terrorists thinking group who consider Muslim killing as obligatory; they had a meeting at a government level with the highest protocol as preparation for getting votes in election. This is filthy politics and this way terrorism will never end in Pakistan and everywhere else.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The second root is the government guardianship and support which they get. The Pakistan secret agencies have issued the names of thirty seven members of the national assembly, who are members of Parliament as supporters of terrorism. Since they were members of Parliament their names were declared but these are not confined to only thirty seven. In every government organization their supporters, guardians are present who provide them support in a highly effective manner and till the time this guardianship, support from the government does not ends this terrorism will not end.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/Terrorism%20in%20PK2_1.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="177" />The third accursed root is the Arab wealth and finances. Every other day our rulers on one phone call will visit Saudi Arabia. A phone call comes and within thirty minutes they are there in Saudi Arab and then give statements that we are ready to sacrifice our lives for Saudi Arabia. Why are you ready to sacrifice your lives and Pakistan for Saudi which is a big Fitnah who is taking lives of innocent Muslims? Why should Pakistan sacrifice itself and its peace for them? This is because this Arab wealth is buying out Pakistanis and this wealth is very effective on us. All these three roots are well known to everyone. Every child knows in Pakistan that these are the three foundations of terrorism. If these three gets uprooted and the day steps are taken to stop the inflow of Arab wealth, to block government sponsorships and ban the issuing of verdicts from Takfirist then we can say that operations in Pakistan have started against terrorism. But if these three are not touched and instead strengthened then no one should remain in this good impression that terrorism will end in Pakistan. This will remain and only at times breaks will come and then again severity comes up. May Allah give the Pakistan nation salvation from these evils.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132476271512764598terrorism_in_PK.jpg', 'fOD5KDV4LKI', '1512765038Terrorism_in_Pak.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:37:25', 'Y'),

The Americans also say that he is a filthy person and everything of his is filthy. This filthy beast has taken a decision to move the<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8.1_2.JPG" alt="" width="286" height="161" /> American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to testify that the capital of Israel is Jerusalem. He has signed this day before and ordered the American government to move the embassy to Jerusalem. Now again he issued a statement that he has delayed his decision for six months. All this was done to test the pulse and see the reactions. First it was the devilish act of Britain to create Israel in Palestine by settling the Jews there and now their act is being completed by Trump and current American government. They want to make Jerusalem formally a capital of Israel. Though Israel has occupied entire Palestine but their desire to make Jerusalem as their capital was not getting fulfilled. The global opinion and entire world was against this but this fool has done this work. This is one grievous act but the more painful is the reaction shown by the Muslim world. Like always some religious groups, entities have issued condemnation statements. It is just a sneezing due to some dust entering inside the nose. They will issue these condemnation statements and then remain silent. Some others do protests, do rallies <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8.2_1.JPG" alt="" width="267" height="177" />after the Friday prayers and consider that they have delivered their rights. As such people gather for Friday prayers and you can easily mobilize them for some protests. Most of them don&rsquo;t even know what is happening. You can use this gathering in anyone&rsquo;s favor. These attendees do not even realize what they are doing and just support for the sake of rewards. Thus few condemnation statements and some rallies is what they have done. This deserves a reply and an intellectual, strong reply against America and Israel is that if American Embassy opens up in Jerusalem then all American Embassies across the world should be closed down. This should be the reaction of Muslims and at least in the Muslim countries and the second all the Embassies of Muslims countries present in America should shut down. What is this statement of condemnation like a sneeze?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In reality this work is a joint program of Trump and Mohammad bin Salman; and also some other Arab nations. Trump first created Iran phobia and made the Arabs scared of Iran; then he promised them that he will support them against Iran. He even took the compensations for supporting them against Iran. Trump will support them against Iran and they will help Trump for supporting Israel. They will not raise their voice, they will not bring their Ambassadors and they will not shutdown the American Embassies in their countries. This is the situation of countries but the people, masses can do this work. The actual reaction should be this only and if this is not done than any other reaction will not be considered as satisfactory and the pleasure of Allah will not be there. All American and Israel Embassies across the world should shut down and only American Embassy should be present in Israel and Israel embassy in America. And all Islamic nations&rsquo; embassies should be removed from America forever. This is the peak of insult, sacrilege of entire Islamic world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This devil who has spoken a lot against Islam sitting there and now in order to affirm the existence of <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8.3_1.JPG" alt="" width="287" height="173" />Israel and to make the world accept Israel he is moving his Embassy to Jerusalem by just one order. If he has started a war against Islam and Muslims, then Muslims should also fight a war against America, Trump and Israel. If the Muslim states are not willing to fight this battle then the Muslim masses, people should do deliver this obligation. The condemnation statements are not enough and in fact these statements needs to be condemned. They are sitting in the drawing room of their homes or in Press club, in media to issue this statement which makes no difference to Israel and America. To carry out a protests on Friday makes no difference for America or Israel.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The nation of people, Muslims masses should rise aginst this, start an uprising and if they cannot do this then these Muslims do not deserve to live if they allow this conspiracy to be successful. The Palestinian groups of Hamas and others have announced a third Intifada. Intifada is a congregational uprising and two such Intifada have taken place in Palestine in which Allah granted a lot of success to Palestinians. This is the third one which they have announced that they will start an uprising but the treachery which the Arab states are doing, we cannot expect anything from them. They will support Trump and Israel and on the contrary rise against Iran. This Arab NATO force which they are making with Pakistani and non-Pakistani countries as an alliance to fight against terrorism. Then you should get up, rise against America. &nbsp;This Intifadashould not be only in Palestine but in fact across the world. There are certain accursed nations who are hosting the Israel Embassy like Turkey, Jordan and even Qatar has an office of Israel. The Muslims across the world should bring their governments under pressure so that their countries disconnect from America and shut down American Embassies. It is shameful that the Embassy of Trump is present in Pakistan and in other Muslimcountries. This is the rights of Qod&rsquo;s and Palestine. <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8.4_1.JPG" alt="" width="254" height="144" />From here you can understand the insight of Imam Khomeini (r.a) and he being despite of all difficultieswhich Iran had he announced Yaum Al Qod&rsquo;s. If Qod&rsquo;s day would have been organized across the world then America would not have dared to make their embassy in Jerusalem or Israel would not have dared to occupy Qod&rsquo;s. The Supreme Leader has done this prediction and he has done this before also when he said Israel would not see next twenty five years. Two days back also he said that Israel will get destroyed. This is their plans but there is Allah&rsquo;s plan also whereby Allah will destroy them in their own deceptive plans. The way they made ISIS and the same ISIS got destroyed by their own hands.</p>', 'Y', 'N', '1516619918151shutdwon.jpg', 'BlFIKeKoijw', '1512793699Shutdown_US_embassies_Globally.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-22 03:18:38', 'Y'),

They have attacked and besieged the country from all over and not even allowing any aid for medication also to reach there. Amongst this one dirty step which the Alliance of Saudi and Emirates did was related to the two groups present in Yemen. In Yemen one group was of Zaidi Shias known as Houthi&rsquo;s and other group was you can say of nationalists and they had both allied together and were confronting Saudi. The leader of the nationalist group was Ali Abdullah Saleh who was allied with Houthis. The Saudi&rsquo;s removed him and made Abdu Rabbe as the leader who was the puppet of Saudi.

Another statement he issued was that if Israel attacked Hezbollah then Lebanese national army will not interfere or react on this. This means that he is telling that there is no issue for Israel to attack Hezbollah. This is a clear policy that they want to trigger a new war. They want to keep Iran occupied somewhere. If the encounter in Lebanon does not takes place and no war happens in Lebanon then they will plan somewhere else. Iran is not even for a single percent ready for any battle in Lebanon or anywhere else.

They have the experience of wars, battles which they have done from their country and even inside other countries.

If they are not successful to create a battle in Lebanon then they will try to engage Iran in a battle somewhere else which might be in Iranian Balochistan which is on Pakistan border.

The atmosphere that is being built up in PK for the upcoming elections of 2018 is very different and dangerous. The arrangements that are being made are different for these elections. In the past all political, religious groups, parties would participate <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/9.1.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="151" />in a specific way to get the elections done. But this time the preparation that are made for elections are different. The new type of groups are being created and certain groups, parties are being wiped off to be replaced with some other parties. These plans seem to be highly dangerous and a big Fitnah (sedition) is clearly seen in the name of election. This Fitnah will drown the people, safety and security of Pakistan. This Fitnah God forbid can turn into a civil war. This kind of preparations are being done and are happening. They are trying to change the direction of Pakistan towards civil war. The Pakistan nation should remain alert and not become a part of Fitnah. If they are dragging the country towards a civil war then the people with their sense should remain alert and not allow this to happen.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They are creating new groups who as per their thinking are not at all political. A political mind even if it is Satanic; since there are no values they oppose each other one day and then next day they sit and become friend. The wrestlers that are being prepared now for the elections are not like those politicians. They are not bringing into field non-political groups. As I said multiple religious groups are being gathered under various contexts. MMA which was made during Musharraf era is again being revived with a new face. Then against them a structure is being formed with suspended groups; these suspended groups are those who were involved in terrorist activities. They are also not politician; they are Takfirists, extremists and warriors. They are non-religious because someone who can kill Muslim has no religion.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One more nonpolitical group which is being made to smell and taste politics are the Sufis and Barelvi who were completely away from politics. Some of them amongst them are those who have even left Shariat and only believe in Tareeqat. Those who have left Shariat for the sake of Tareeqat never come near politics but now they are being prepared for the political arena. First they got Deobandi into politics. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/9.2.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="182" />Initially it was only one Deobandi group which was in politics then Musharraf got others into politics. Now they are doing the same for Barelvi. This way the politics will be done on the basis of religious sect. When Barelvi, Deobandi, Shias will come out in the field to confront each other politically then this will turn into religious confrontation. They will not do politics instead they will bring their religious sentiments out in the field. If you see these sit in protests, which I said this is a series which has started and it will go on till elections. But this sectarian, ideological, religious politics which they are playing will take a dangerous shape. But whenever there are conflicts in our country; irrespective of who is fighting but one group suffers the most, gets killed and they are Shias. The fighting is with others but they start with Shias. The politics which we have done under the name of Shias has badly failed even in Shias areas of Gilgit Baltistan. The politics is merciless and when the suspended terrorist groups come out to fight elections then the expectations are dreadful things to happen out of this mercilessness</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The consequences of the Fitnah that has come out of elections in Shia areas like Parachinar has been horrible and we have paid a heavy price for it and many sacrifices have been given. A fitnah which distanced Shia from Shia and the leader of Parachinar got killed in the elections. These Fitnah&rsquo;s can be defeated only by the sense of people. Ameerul Momineen (a.s) has said that do not become a ride for Fitnah and do not feed them milk.&nbsp; We think this is unnatural and the atmosphere that is outside Pakistan we cannot afford Pakistan to be victimized by an internal civil war.

There was lot of warming going on since last few weeks for this election but this is also a big event that has taken place on the global horizon specifically in context to the results of the election that has come out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Internal issues in Iran</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_1.png" alt="" width="335" height="211" />I have been mentioning this before as well that the direction which the internal issues in Iran were heading towards were related to these elections. The Supreme Leader in last two years on various occasions, events, meetings has been emphasizing on one point to people, leaders, scholars, parliamentarian, forces and that point was to be revolutionary and a regeneration of revolutionary thoughts. This is because during this entire period where there has been problems for Iran internally as well externally specifically related to what happened in last 8 years; during the 4 years tenure of the incumbent President and the 4 yrs. prior to that of President Ahmadinejad. During this period a severe economic crisis was created for Iran to change the direction of Islamic Revolution and to reduce the effectiveness of Islamic Revolution. This crisis has shown its effect because prior to this war was there and all possible tactics were tried but failed against Iran. Then these experts sat inside the country and outside; and decided that the only effective weapon against Iran are economic crisis. This is because all other means put more pressure on government and forces less on people whereas economic sanctions directly hits the masses. Like if there is war the more pressure is on armed forces though some pressure is there on people as well. Then the war spending results into more pressure on government and some indirect effect comes on people. Similarly other plans and seditions that were created against Iran the pressure came on government. If there are strong visionary people in the government then they cannot be tamed and succumbed with these tactics. When the enemies create a front from outside it helps the state to stand more on their feet and become strong; this is what happened with Iran in the past with wars and other sanctions which made Iran stronger. Hence they decided to create economy crisis because with this the first party that gets effected are the masses. If there is inflation in prices, lack of goods, approach to necessities of life becomes difficult then the pressure comes on people. And when people come under pressure there are very few who can sustain such pressure because not everyone is prepared and trained for this, but for the special ruling classes they can sustain as they have practiced and ready for it. But amongst people majority have not practiced and they surrender to pressure. This is what happened in Iran. The Atomic plan of Iran for which there was clear policy that they will not stop this plan but it had to be stopped not due to war; because during war time this plan was ongoing and could not be stopped. They got pressure on the people through economic sanctions and this was done by a group inside Iran and another from outside. These groups from inside were sending signals outside based on which they were making policies and as a result an agreement was forced with these devil powers; and the atomic energy plants were stopped, dismantled and totally made nonfunctional.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Revolutionary and Liberal groups contesting in Elections</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_1.png" alt="" width="235" height="139" />During elections also the effect of the same were seen. There were two groups in opposition in these elections. As such there are two groups but they say three groups. The two groups are reformists and Principlists; whereas the third group which is being portrayed is that of President Roohani who calls it as Justice. Practically there are two groups only; which as per Imam Khomeini (r.a) interpretation they are Revolutionary and Liberal. The liberals are those who say that we cannot run this nation based on the revolutionary principles because due to this we will be<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_1.png" alt="" width="223" height="169" /> disconnected from the world, hardships will increase and this group was led by Hashemi Rafsanjani. He has these policies and was running his lobbies based on these principles and his two inheritors ex-president Khatami and President Rouhani had plans to continue his path only. They want to finish the revolutionary spirit and want to revive the economic development of Iran and its relationship with other nations. We should leave the revolution, oppressed people, weak people, Mahdaviat, Islamic government, confronting Israel, Taghoot because this is becoming an obstacle for us in our relationship with other nations. The leadership of revolutionary thinking was and is with the Supreme Leader (d.a). He is holding the reigns of revolution and also Iran with him and to keep the nation on the revolutionary track and also the government, people is the strategy of leader and the revolutionary group. For this the leader has been emphasizing since more than two years on revolutionary principles.</p>\r\n<p>I said before at that time that one encounter is about to start between these two groups; which could be clashes on street or political or in elections or in some other form. This is what has happened where a clash is directly seen between the revolutionary and liberal thoughts. The leader demanded from scholars, intellectual and everyone to revive revolutionary thinking as our survival lies only in being revolutionary. Everyone should be revolutionary that is Seminary, teachers, scholars, students, university, business, workers, rulers , forces , ministries all should make revolutionary as being the basis and criteria. For the enemies also what pinches them is not Iranianism but revolution in Iran. All the plans which they make are not against Iran but against revolution. The way the leader said at the time of this nuclear agreement that their problem is not Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program but their problem is with Iran&rsquo;s revolutionary program. Today the enemy has also openly said that their problem is with the revolutionary movement of Iran. I said before as well that to make Iran a nuclear power was initiated by America during the era of Shah. The Shah with American support started to deploy the Bushehr power plant and it was an American plan to make Iran as an atomic power. But after the revolution America does not wants Iran to be nuclear or any other form of power. What difference has taken place before and after the revolution? The difference is only revolutionary Ideology of Imamat, Wilayat. First it was Taghoot in Iran and now it is Wilayat. It was Wilayat of Taghoot before and now it is Wilayat of Allah. Hence all the conspiracies are against this system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Negligence of Revolutionaries</strong></p>\r\n<p>The revolutionaries also become victim of negligence because when media creates an environment with lies then even the hearts of big revolutionaries shiver. So those who cannot do proper analysis of situation they become afraid and scared. When such atmosphere of fear is made as to this will happen, that will happen then many get confused and afraid. Allah (s.w.t) has mentioned in Quran that when companions of Prophet were informed that people are gathering against you, forces are gathered against you, then the faith of believers would increase and they would not get scared. But at times the revolutionary come under pressure and become companion with some Taghoot and Satanic thoughts. Here also in these elections two ideological thoughts confronted but on both side the same slogan of economic growth and revival was raised. The revolutionary candidate also raised the slogan of economic growth and the current President also was also banking on the same. Since there is an economic crisis the revolutionary candidate also raised economy as the prime issue. The other candidate told people that if a revolutionary becomes President then the relationship with world will break, war will start and everyone will attack Iran.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_1.png" alt="" width="271" height="149" />This happened at the time when the conference that took place on 21<sup>st</sup> May also had an effect on these elections. The American President Trump came from USA to Saudi Arabia for the Islamic Nations conference to chair this conference. This was done at the time when the<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_1.png" alt="" width="134" height="176" /> elections in Iran were going on; and on the same day the verdict against Sheikh Essa Qassem was passed.&nbsp; This conference date was announced before and the agenda of this conference was only Iran. He came to create fear against Iran, support an alliance against Iran and do a covenant with the Islamic nations to take steps against Iran. On one hand this acting of Trump and Saudi rulers. The conference date was announced much before and in parallel to the election. The clear message for this conference was that it was a plan for war against Iran and only the liberals can protect Iran from this war.&nbsp; Since this liberal group has avoided war before at the time of nuclear agreement and now since already there is economic crisis going on and Iranian masses cannot afford to have another war; with an internal and external coordination this election took place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Universal essence of Democracy</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the essence of any election whereby people decide between right and wrong. And when people select they do it like this only. I have said this before also that if there are elections anywhere in the world if Imam Ali and Muwaiya contest in election then people will select Muwaiya only because the policies of Muwaiya are in favor of people whereas the policies of Ameerul Momineen (a.s) are not in favor of people. Hence due to people an established government of Ali (a.s) comes down whereas a rebellion Muwaiya turns into Khilafat. People will always select falsehood they will never select the Justice of Ali (a.s).&nbsp; Ameerul Momineen (a.s) will not become elected Imam of people. This is the reason Allah has not kept the system of guidance on elections but on selection based on divine criteria.<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/6_1.png" alt="" width="250" height="167" /> Wherever there are elections such things are expected whereby a great personality, philosopher like Misbah Yazdi is rejected by people and people elect seditionist as they have the rights to select whom they want.&nbsp; When people have to elect then the color of people is there on the elections. This is because people are under various types of pressure and they are effected. People are afraid of weapons, Taghoot, starvation, hunger and when people are told that you have to bear starvation, fight wars then people come the pressure of wealth and comfort. You can never see in history that ordinary people have discarded wealth and accepted the pressure of being imprisoned.&nbsp; A community under pressure can never decide correct. This is a deficiency in the essence of democracy that the category who has to select does not possess the ability to decide. Like those who make policies in cabinet; you do not allow a taxi driver, farmer, ordinary person to come in cabinet and become your minister. The same person who has casted vote to make you President why can&rsquo;t he become your cabinet minister. This old woman has given vote to you for becoming president. The one who is President Maker, king maker can&rsquo;t become minister? You said no we cannot do this because she cannot do this. You need an educated, intellectual, experience person to become minister. This means there is some criteria and merit required.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Results outcome of pressure</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Iranian election 1800 people registered their names for Presidential election and out of this 6 got passed; out of which 2 stepped back and four contested. From these four two got very few votes even less then rejected vote. The result of this election came out due to internal and external pressure. The liberal thoughts that revolution is an obstacle got victory. The President in his first tenure is bit careful as he has to fight next election also. In this first tenure he is careful but in the second tenure now he knows that legally he cannot participate in next elections and these are his last days; and in these last days the power shows its effects on this person in authority. The way the <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/7_1.png" alt="" width="174" height="174" />past President Ahmadinejad; in his first four years he spent in the obedience of leader and the next four years he spent in disobedience of leader despite that he was a revolutionary personality. In the last four years he become stubborn and came in opposition to Leader. This president from the beginning was not on the revolutionary line hence these upcoming four years would be tougher for the revolution. I am not saying for Iran because the liberal thinking might give benefits to Iran but not to revolution the way Imam had said the liberal thoughts can never protect the revolution. Imam had pledged that till the time I am alive I will not allow any liberal person to come in power. But something that has to be done with people there is no guarantee, because there is no guarantee of people as they might come under pressure or some greed. If the insight, sense of people increase then it is possible that people itself become a wall of resistance and as Quran said that they become an Ummah. When the people become Ummah then they struggle. We pray to Allah to protect the Islamic revolution from all forms of evils internally and externally and join it with the revolution of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s). We should not be worried because as per Iran laws the final power is that of Wilayat e Faqeeh. Though the President can create problems the way Bani Sadr did and some other ups and down came, but since the final power lies with Wali-e-Faqeeh hence we should not be disturbed. We pray that Allah should grant long life, health to the Supreme Leader and till the time this personality is present the revolution is insured. And even if after him someone will come out from the treasure of Allah who will keep the nation of the revolutionary path.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132480921513090403top.png', '', '1513090403Article_-_Iran_Presidential_Elections_2017.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:41:33', 'Y'),
(95, '2017-12-12', 2, '190', 'Trump milking Saudi Cow', 'Trump milking Saudi Cow', 'trump-milking-saudi-cow', NULL, '<p align="center"><strong>Trump milking Saudi Cow</strong><strong><br /> Ustad Syed Jawad Naqvi</strong></p>\r\n<p>21<sup>st</sup> May has been an accursed day because under the leadership of Kufr (Infidelity) an Islamic conference had taken place. The leader of conference, the chairperson of the gathering is a Kafir and not just infidel in fact a staunch enemy of Allah, Islam, Muslims, and Shiite. Under this persons leadership the leaders of Muslims states gathered in Riyadh; that land which is considered as the land of Islam. If you see in history the accursed days for Muslims this day is unique in terms of its bad omen. In past one Islamic ruler would disgracefully submit to an infidel and its effect would be in some region but here all Muslim nations expect for few like Iran, Syria and Iraq I am not aware if they were present. They called the ruler of Sudan he did not come because he has international tribunal and had fear of being arrested. All the states leaders came, they participated and did allegiance on the hands of enemy. What a disgraceful act they did on the land of Islam.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trump &ndash; Enemy of Islam</strong></p>\r\n<p>On the land of Hejaz under the leadership of Kufr Muslims gathered and in that what was decided. What the Muslim leaders said and what this Kafir said? They both said the same that Iran is dangerous, it is interfering, and we have to destroy Iran and unite against Iran.&nbsp; Under the leadership of that enemy whose enmity is open. In America also this Satan, corrupt, devilish person Trump who started his election campaign in enmity of Islam. The entire world remembers all this as it was few months back. In <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_2.png" alt="" width="250" height="148" />his campaigns he expressed openly his enmity towards Islam. He termed Islam as terrorism and used filthy words against sanctities of religion. And after elections; the first Presidential order which he gave was to put a ban on seven Islamic nations to enter America. The same open devil enemy comes to the land of Muslims, that too in the center of Muslims where all Islamic states are invited to come. He comes with licentious women, he gives lecture to Muslim leaders about Islam as to which Islam is correct which is not. Then sit, listen to him and then agree with him to confront Iran. This is such a lowly, disgraceful act which these Muslim rulers have done would not get repeated in terms of its lowliness. All those who participate there and did allegiance to this open enemy have done disgraceful and humiliated thing. They have wounded the heart of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and of Imam e Asr (a.t.f.s). They have washed off all the efforts of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s); they have denied the Quran. They have openly disobeyed Allah and announced openly a war against Allah by attending this conference. They could not get more humiliated then this.</p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_2.png" alt="" width="246" height="166" />Trump has come on his first Presidential international journey and he has visited the Muslim capital due to presence of Mecca and Medina. Then from Riyadh he took direct flight to Tel Aviv, Israel. This in itself is a symbolic flight to Israel which is the Jewish capital and then after attending a NATO conference he went straight to Vatican to meet Pope of Rome. He went to the capital of Christianity. In both places you can see the pictures on the internet. He went to Jerusalem, Quds and visited the sacred wall of<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_2.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" /> Jews; expressed his etiquettes. He wrote his supplication in the crack of that wall like the Shias do Ariza. He kept the Jewish cap on his head and expressed his respect to the Jewish sanctity. Then he went to the Pope of Rome in Vatican who is the leader of Catholics and demonstrated respect, listened to his counselling, he kissed his hands and his wife and daughter were also dressed in black with head covered as no woman can go in front of Pope bareheaded. He is the leader of superpower and went to the religious head of Christians. He visited the 3 religious capitals. In the religious capitals of Jews and Christians he acted respectfully and honored it but in the Islamic capital he insulted and dishonored. He has insulted everyone; including hosts, guest, the sanctities of religion. Those in Pakistan who are passionate about defending the Haramain now they have silence of death on them. Those who have made forces for assassinating Shias now they have no words. There is no movement, action, words anywhere on media or by these groups in Pakistan. They are all dumb that how all Muslims went in front of this Kafir and did allegiance. All these Mufti&rsquo;s who issue big verdicts are now dead silent.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever has happened is highly lessonful for the entire Islamic world. I will now mention the background of this event. Trump says he is an enemy of Islam but Saudi king says America and Israel are not the enemies of Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister has also said that Saudi is no more our enemy. They are increasing their friendship now. But America has never hidden their enmity against Islam and Muslims. Imam Khomeini (r.a) has mentioned that all problems of Muslims are due to America and it is due to relationship which Muslim leaders have kept with America they are suffering. And amongst all American Presidents Trump is the most open enemy of Islam and Muslims; who has blatantly announced that i am an enemy of Islam and Muslims. Then he comes to Muslim capital and disgraces them and these Muslim rulers have even kissed his hands. What has actually h happened? Why Trump despite of being enemy has visited here and this event which has taken place of 21<sup>st</sup> May was what?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Saudi Arabia &ndash; A big fat milking cow</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_2.png" alt="" width="335" height="211" />In his election campaign Trump has said this several times whereby he has condemned Arab and European nations that you are burden on America, you are useless people. America spends all their budget on you but this is not going to happen anymore. Now also in the NATO conference he said this that you have to pay for your own expenses. We will not defend anyone. He also said that we will not leave the Arabs on their own and specifically for Saudi Arabia the Trump&rsquo;s statement which everyone published in American and global media, that Saudi Arabia is big fat milking cow. We have lean cows in Pakistan which only milks half liter. But the cows in America and Europe with bio technology they have changed their genes and made them artificial cows. These Cow&rsquo;s milk 100 liters and the cow itself cannot lift it. They give such foods, medicines, injections to the cow by which it gives much larger quantity of milk then expectation which is milked by machines. Trump said that Saudi Arabic is a cow, which means this is the vision of Trump about Saudi that it is my cow.</p>\r\n<p>You can estimate from the speech of Trump in this conference as to whether it was a conference of rulers of Islamic states or a gathering of cows. In America there is one more terminology as Cowboy; one who herds the cows. In ancient times a culture of cowboy got established there. Here also we wear those tight pants, shirts on which it is written also some times as Cowboy. Today the rowdies are known as Cowboy but in the past it was used for herders of Cow. Trump is a herder of cows, who nurtures cow, he is a trader, businessman and he knows business. He has controlled this Arabic cow and cows of Islamic nations.&nbsp; He has said this with elaboration that Saudi Arabia is a big fat cow and we will Milk it completely and the day it stops milking we will leave it in desert alone. This was this statement about his policy after becoming President.</p>\r\n<p>First he expressed that Saudi is the cow of Trump then he issued another statement. They were all cows who were gathered together and a cowboy addressed them. But in Iran against whom this entire gathering was done not a single child got afraid of them. If you gather all the cows, sheep in your village and address them it is nothing. In order to bring this cow under control he has said in his election campaign that Arabs cannot survive for even a day if America does not protects them. And this is something right which he has said that no Arab nations can survive even for day if America and Britain lifts their support. Their people will shred them to pieces which you have seen in Libya, Egypt, and Iraq. And the most dreadful will be Saudi Arabia where the people would turn Aale Saudi into particles if America leaves them on their own. He reminded them that without our support and help you cannot survive for a day. And then he also said that we have to protect you and for that you pay us and give us compensation. In order to control this cow he mentioned Iran as a biggest threat in the world. How can Iran be a threat, when you have restricted Iran from making atomic bombs?</p>\r\n<p>In this same trip he went to Israel and said that Iran cannot make Atomic bombs till the doomsday. The Israelites should not be afraid that we have controlled Iran so much that Iran can never make nuclear weapons. In the conference of cows he said that Iran is a big threat. He has made them afraid, scared that Iran will not leave you alive for a day if we are not with you. He signed contract of billions of dollars before the conference for weapons which Saudi, Emirates, Qatar, etc. has to buy. With these contracts he has milked these cows for generations to come and in return he will give modern weapons and ammunition. What will be these used for? Look at this cow that now itself its situation is such that it is not able to give milk. They cannot milk because if you look at the policies which they have made in Saudi Arabia whereby they have imposed taxes on their people; it was a tax free state because they have been selling the oil and gas and running the state. Now it has become difficult for them to run the state with the oil, gas income. All construction work has been stopped in Saudi, their factories have closed. This is because the milk that is left with this cow of Trump is only left for Trump. I can say with certainty that this is the final agreement which Trump has done with Saudi because after this America will leave this cow isolated in the dessert and on that day the people of Saudi will be destroyed by these Bedouins. This was the background of this conference whereby he targeted many targets with one arrow. The economy of America which was shaking and under crisis, he has strengthened the American economy for generations to come. The entire wealth of Arab nations he has moved to America in return of weapons. Since Trump is a dirty businessman; he is into bull fights, wrestling, casinos and all such dirty business he does. Now also he has done a dirty busines by creating fear from Iran, Shiite he has started to milk this cow. I have said this before also that America has also decided to get rid of this accursed Aale Saud. They also consider them as accursed because Saudi is an ignorant, fascist state which does oppression. Yesterday United Nations has condemned Saudi Arabic for bulldozing a Shia town in Qatif. UN has condemned them as this city has historical heritage and not because of Shiite. UN has not been merciful to Shia they want to protect the heritage of Al Awamiya. America wants to destroy Saudi but want to reap big benefits out of them prior to destruction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mohammad bin Salman &ndash; The Trump card</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_2.png" alt="" width="230" height="141" />The act which they have done here is that the King Salman who has Alzheimer disease where the mind disconnects and a person forgets everything for hours. May Allah cure everyone from this disease except King Salman. For hours his mind gets disconnected and he does not realize whatever is going around him. His son Mohammad bin Salman is now running the state, he is a stupid, foolish person who has learned politics from video games. They teach him a lesson and he starts to do it. He started a battle of Yemen and now he is making a big rented force from various nations to stop the path of Mahdaviat. The interview which he gave live on NBC Channel that Iran believes in Mahdaviat and reappearance which means He will come and establish the system of governance globally and Iran is preparing the ground for this return, at present why it is necessary to fight against Shias because they are preparing the grounds for reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s). This foolish person spoke this which America and Israel has kept as secret since long so that no one should know why they are enemies of Shia. They are preparing for every mistakes and he is prepared to do everything. If he fights then also he gets destroyed and if Saudi does not fight then also they will be destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Things America has done for milking this cow</strong></p>\r\n<p>America has done strange things to milk this cow. First they made them do Jihad in Afghanistan, it was all the wealth of Saudi, Emirates and then with this money they created havoc in Pakistan by creating terrorists. Then again they took money from Saudi and<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/6_2.png" alt="" width="320" height="160" /> Arabs to finish these terrorists. They made Al Qaeda and now to finish Al Qaeda they took money. They took money for creating Mujahideen and also to finish them. ISIS is the richest force of America which was made to destroy Shiite using money of Shiite; then again to finish ISIS they took money from them. In Syria they made forces with their money and now to stop them again they used the Saudi and Arab money. This is how they are milking this cow. There are other ways also they have done on how the oil companies have done this which is another story. What is happening now and is about to happen now. They are about to do this now. They pushed them in Syria and then to get them out they are demanding more money.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disgrace for Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this situation a strange accident has happened with Pakistan. Pakistan likes to put their feet on every banana skin to slip on the road. These insane rulers of Pakistan wherever they see something to fall, they fall down. Other nations try to protect themselves, they try to destroy their nation themselves. The other nations try to grow, they want to decline. Other nations bring foreign investment but Pakistan rulers sell their nation. See what Pakistan got in this conference. The Pakistani rulers went to attend this conference. Just see that no one from Saudi state came to receive them on the airport; the Pakistani ambassador came to receive him and take them to royal family. There is a discussion going on in Pakistani media that the Pakistani Prime Minister was not allowed to deliver speech, he was not given a warm welcome and a picture was also not taken. He had no picture with Trump, King Salman, nor with wife of Trump or his daughter; might be one picture with governor of Riyadh. The media also has ignored them and they have not even shown them anywhere. The media is now quoting that forty other countries were also there and they did not speak so what happened if our Prime Minister did not get a chance to speak. This is like if there is a rich person who has a loafer son who becomes the owner of everything. Now when this happens all other goons, rowdies in the area become friend with him to milk him as much possible. All the nations who went there they were in hope to milk this cow. But see whom did this cow give what? The entire milk was taken away by Trump so what did Pakistan get? Why should they take your picture? They do not treat you as a leader, they consider you as a paid employee. They have done this only till now. They have been paying you for the services you have been provided. They have kept you on rent and those who are kept as employees are not counted as guest. They do not allow such workers to sit with high level guests, make pictures and deliver speeches. This was your worth. The cow gives other things also; it gives milk as well as cow dung. This cow of Trump, the Arabic cow has made Pakistan dirty with its cow dung. They gave this waste to media, rulers and did whatever they wanted them to do. Now you were present and listened to the speech of Trump that Iran has to be isolated.&nbsp; You have listened to the insane King Salman&rsquo;s speech that Iran is an enemy. Still you are saying that this was an Islamic gathering of unity? Against whom?</p>\r\n<p>Anyone who takes help from foreign nation in the name of religion, whether Shia or Sunni and creates discord in his country, does treachery with his country that money is garbage, dung and not any support. The foreign money which makes Pakistan weak and sectarianism is created in Pakistan, that foreign money which creates groups in Pakistan is not support, it is excreta, waste irrespective of who gives. This is what you have got this waste from that cow.</p>\r\n<p>This was a foolish step of Arab and West. You can see all the big names in Pakistan, who are supporters, boasters have all become dead silent. What face you will show to the world. You went into the leadership of Kafir and sat there and passed resolution against Islamic country, against a Muslim nation, against Shiite; now what face you will show in front of community. This is a foolishness of enemy whereas this is deception from Allah. On one side there is a stratagem of Satan and on other hand there is Allah&rsquo;s stratagem against Satan. Even if Shia would have put all their strength they would not have been able to disgrace them the way they have disgraced themselves with their own wealth now with this filthy conference. Could Shia have proved that these Muslim nations are followers and army of enemies? No one would have believed this if this would have come from Shias and everyone would have said that this is prejudice. Today their rulers openly in front of the world, media presented that who we are? Who can hide this? This is Allah&rsquo;s deception that they got disgraced by their own hands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Separation of path between Muslim rulers and people</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/7_2.png" alt="" width="269" height="168" />One more thing which they did was; Imam Khomeini (r.a) presented a path to the Muslim nations; that they should separate their paths from the rulers of Islamic states who are slaves of West. After this conference the path of Muslims nations have been separated from their rulers. The Muslim nations are never ready to have friendship with Israel, they are not ready for fights amongst Muslim nations; they are not prepared for Shia, Sunni war. These seditionists are ones who under the leadership of Kufr, fire of hell want to do all this. Where are these Muftis now? Why they can&rsquo;t remember the verses of Quran? Why they can&rsquo;t remember the Hadith now? Why they can&rsquo;t remember the Islamic laws now? Such a big crime they committed openly and these filth eating Mufti are sitting silently. This scene is not like this that media keeps on confusing the people, and Trump comes and fools the people. In the past America used to make Muslims as donkey but a donkey is of no use, but they are now making cow who can be milked. It is not that only Arab nations are cows instead all Muslims nations. They are cows in terms of foolishness as well as giving benefits of others. This herder of Muslims, this cowboy came and made agreements; made the future of American nation for next twenty years. If I get opportunity sometime else I will explain how in one night he solved the problem of American economy. Obama in his entire tenure could not solve it but he immediately after coming in few months as President did this. Everyone was thinking he was a stupid, foolish person but this fool in one day took the American economy on peak and what he did with this cow. He gave this clear message that he believes in religion; respects Judaism and Christianity but not Islam.</p>\r\n<p>He has said this in his campaigns, Presidential addresses and now in this conference openly that there is no sanctity for Muslims. Now also if the Muslims do not awaken, these leaders, scholars still if they do not understand they will also become disgraced in every country. At present this filthy prince in Saudi Arabia is ready to spread sedition in every country. The countries where Shias are there but no Shia governance there also the pressure on Shias is increasing. This is Saudi policy that Shias should be eliminated in Bahrain; in Saudi they are cleansing the Shia towns; Emirates have removed all Shias one by one; similarly in other nations also where Shias are in majority there are blasts, explosions.&nbsp; They want to pressurize Shias in all possible ways; by attacking, put cases on them, besieging them. In the upcoming days the pressure on Shias will increase everywhere on the instructions of Saudi the way they have done in Nigeria. But this is the plan of Satan and they are not aware of the plans of Allah. Allah says that when they do their deception Allah traps them in their own stratagems and destroys them. Now the signs are clear that this royal family will be destroyed after this conference which they arranged under the leadership of Trump. We also pray that May Allah very soon give to all Muslim nations get freedom from these accursed beings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132481371513141256top.png', '', '1513141256Trump_milking_Saudi_Cow.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2017-12-14 11:42:18', 'Y');

This is not the correct way and this vision is not correct. In Middle East there is a battle going on since long, and if we enter its background and look at the players of this battle then on 21<sup>st</sup> May in the conference; their Satanic leader Trump expressed this and prior to this the Saudi Foreign Minister and Crown Prince also has said this that the sensitivity has developed in Middle East after the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Prior to the Islamic revolution Middle East was a calm region with some discrete events happening which were specific to that part of the region.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Israel before and after 1979</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_3.png" alt="" width="271" height="202" />After formation of Israel in 1947 Middle East has always remained disturbed. The usurping Israeli state was announced in the same year of 1947 which was also year of formation of Pakistan. The central point of this disturbance was the issue of Israel, Qod&rsquo;s that is Masjidul Aqsa. There were wars fought; in one of the battles the Arabs were badly defeated which was in 1968 whereby Israel occupied region beyond Palestine heading inside Lebanon, Syrian and Jordan borders. With this the Arab power against Israel fell down and Israel emerged as a power in region, well supported by West and with the treachery of Arabs. After this the passion for fighting and standing against Israel got down significantly which was present within the period of wars. There were guerilla attacks taking place by Palestinian groups and many painful incidents did happen during this period as well but were not of the nature that they indulged the entire region into it. The issue of Palestine was and is a major issue for Muslims and with every day passing it has been benefitting Israel only due to the aggression of West and treachery of Arabs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We can say that there were two political eras that passed in Middle East before 1979 for Israel; one was from the time of its formation till 1968 and then from 1968 to 1979. There were some other incidents also that took place during this period like formation of Socialist government in Iraq, Syria, and Algeria which were all internal issues of nations but not impacting the entire region except the Palestine issue. The issue of Palestine was making the roots of Israel stronger every day and Arabs were getting weaker. In 1968 Israel transformed everything in its favor and Arabs with disgrace gave their lands to Israel and sat inside their homes quietly. From that time till 1979 Israel progresses, developed and it established diplomatic relationships with many Arab nations.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1979 the situation changed in a highly unexpected manner which was the Islamic Revolution in Iran; a purely Ideological and Islamic change. It took place in that country within Middle East which has a different demographics specifically that it was a county with Shia majority. With the Islamic revolution the chapter changed and this change was that Israel which has defeated all Arab nations and occupied lands in its bordering nations of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan. After this Israel had also planned to occupy these lands completely. At that time only they mentioned that the land required for Israel to progress is from River Nile to Euphrates. Nile is the river that originates from Egypt and Euphrates is that river which flows in Syria, Turkey and Iraq. This means they declared that everything between Egypt and Iraq is all Israel that is Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and even Iraq would be Israel. They made attempts for this and were highly hopeful that this will happen and they will occupy everything between Nile and Euphrates. They started from Jerusalem and entered inside the borders of neighboring Arab nations, hence now we can even proceed further. This was their map but the Islamic Revolution that took place under the leadership of Imam Khomeini changed their plans. Now those who were planning from Nile to Euphrates got concerned on how to first secure what they have occupied till now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_3.png" alt="" width="250" height="158" />The Islamic Revolution changed the map. The communities got aroused and awakened; Egypt, Lebanon got awakened and these nations and their dead organizations got inspired with this revolution. Those who were ready for compromises with Israel and had laid off all their weapons; again revived themselves getting into a mode of Islamic resistance. One sample of this could be seen with Hezbollah outside Palestine and Hamas inside. These groups started an uprising and confrontation with Israel on a new direction.&nbsp; The supporters of Israel also changed their strategy after Islamic Revolution. They very well understand what revolution is.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recognition of Islamic Revolution by West</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The westerners understand the Revolutionmuch better than anyone else, even more than the Iranians. They know the soul and spirit of Revolution because they plan, study and analyze it from inside. They understand the volcano inside the Revolution and its power to devastate prevailing systems. I have mentioned this before that Revolution has two specialties; one is to demolishthe existing systems. If a revolution does not destroy and uproot the foundations of evil systems, then that is not revolution it could be reformation. Revolution is not replacement of roof or repairing of walls. Revolution means destroying corrupt regimes, systems and second specialty is establishing new systems on new foundations. This revolution is known to West and not taught to Muslims. Muslims have seen the revolution and raised slogans in favor of revolution but they don&rsquo;t even know what revolution is. Revolution means to destroy prevailing corrupt systems and replace it with new divine system. West and Israel were aware about the strength of Revolution as they witnessed how it uprooted an emperor of a big nation (Iran) that too through the hands of a Maulana. This is the power of revolutionary movement but when this movement turns into rituals and rites then ancestral rituals, rites can only tranquilize sentiments; they don&rsquo;t have the power to run a movement. In a cultural, ritualistic religion the passions, sentiments are on its peak but these sentiments do not come to any use; cultural people get contented by releasing the sentiments. Revolution is the name of a volcanic eruption. West understood the power of Revolution and how much damage it can do to their existing systems. Everyone new about the corruption in Arab nations and they also knew that Israel is the most corrupt because they themselves made it. Now a revolutionary typhoon has come, a volcano has erupted which is primarily aimed at uprooting corrupt and transgressing systems. This was very clearly known to them that Israel is the corrupt system without any doubts. Shias were and till now in conjectures about Wilayat e Faqeeh and Imam Khomeini but Israel, western powers and their allies were not doubt.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They started to do many things and operations to control this revolution and it would prolong our discussion if we get into all these steps they took till now. At present they are in the phase of terrorism whereby they made terrorist groups and through them they carried terrorist activities against Shias in various countries. They fought war with Iran, placed restrictions, carried out target killing, they waited from Imam&rsquo;s demise but they were despaired everywhere and were unsuccessful. Then they made terrorist groups like Taliban, Al Qaeda and last one ISIS and there also they brutally failed so now they have made a Takfirist NATO. They have gathered rented forces and certain states together are going to fight against Iran. This is the background of the situation in Middle East till now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We cannot ignore the materialistic dimension of Middle East as it the biggest energy reservoir for the world whereby oil and gas is in abundance; and this is an additional attraction in Middle East. When oil and gas was discovered in Middle East by the Western people only; they ate themselves and made the Arabs also to eat; they made their own nations and also developed Middle East. These same Arab countries in the Middle East if you look at their picture fifty years back they were all ruined states which today are cities with big skyscrapers. The abundance of oil has also made it a center of attention.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Satanic Conference</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_3.png" alt="" width="300" height="170" />In the current situation they arranged a convention in which the last one held was the Riyadh Conference on 21<sup>st</sup> May which became an accursed day in the history of Muslims. Prior to this also the Muslim rulers did treachery but in covert manner they would mix up with enemies. But on this day they openly under the leadership of open infidel, that American President and its Cabinet who has announced a war against Islam and Muslim; and he has won the elections under this slogan of Islam enmity. These Muslim rulers gathered under the leadership of this tyrant Satan and he delivered a lecture that too on the topic of Islam to the Muslim leaders. After he leaves within two weeks the first consequences are seen in Qatar whereby the relationships were severed with Qatar. Trump himself quoted formally and have issued this written statement that whatever happened with Qatar was that after I delivered the lecture in the convention in which I presented two types of Islam; one was an extremist Islam and other peaceful; during the lecture itself all the Arab delegates started to point fingers towards Qatar. He said this happened there only where fingers were pointed towards Qatar.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The second thing that happened was whereby various other speeches were given in which only one agenda came out which was to isolate Iran, apply extreme restrictions on Iran and pressurize Iran to leave its existing system. This was the formal agenda of this conference which was<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_3.png" alt="" width="120" height="155" /> openly announced and did not hide it. Then after these two incidents happened in a very short span; though other incidents also like attack on Sheikh Essa Qassem&rsquo; s house in Bahrain which happened on 21<sup>st</sup> May. In Mosul the Iraqi forces prior to Trump&rsquo;s visit had almost overtaken ISIS. In a 3 sq. kms area of Mosul which has got borders from Turkey and Syria. Turkey is protecting ISIS in that region and American forces are only doing the last defense of ISIS so that they are not completely wiped off from there. In Syria also they are making this efforts to create an area between Syria and Iraq which remains isolated from both these countries and only Turkey supports this area where ISIS will be inhabited. You have seen in the news that American army is bombarding Syrian force the moment they take any steps towards annihilating ISIS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since ISIS is a very heavy capital for them they want to protect it. These are evil facts but due to media people are not able to believe it. The terrorists were not made on their own, a heavy investment of billions and trillions of dollars were spent on creating them, arming them, provide them with supplies and logistics. The money spent is much more than the spending on a formal army. If you want to do business and want to move goods from one location to another, you have to pay a particularrent but if you want to do something illegal then you have to spend double. The money spent on terrorists in Pakistan if was spent on Pakistan army it would have made it the world&rsquo;s most powerful army. Those who make informal armies they have to spend more and this is what they did. This is their asset and capital now and whichever country who made the forces it is their capital. They will never end terrorism because they have spent so much on it, so how will those who made it to allow you to finish terrorism. They keep on changing places but they will not end. This is a policy which we should know that anyone who invests on a capital they will not allow it to be transferred anywhere. They are relocating ISIS now in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There are three countries which are ready to host ISIS. One is Libya where one part of ISIS has already been moved and then other two nations Afghanistan and Pakistan where they plan to move rest. Their major focus to relocate them is in Libya and Afghanistan but Pakistan can also become their strong base because Pakistan is prepared for this as there is experience of terrorism and they get cooperation from state. The kind of cooperation which terrorists get in Pakistan is not given anywhere else in the world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an illusion if someone thinks that since a Takfirist NATO is created there is no need for ISIS, they are going to remain. The Takfirist NATO has openly announced that their target is Iran. The Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman in his public live broadcast interview on MBC and Al Arabia channel a month back mentioned the same. When he was asked that you have conflicts with Iran so is there any possibility of resolving this. He said it is not possible because there is an Ideological issue whereby the Shias and Iran believe in Imam Mahdi revolution with which Shias want to dominate the world. Iranians are preparing the ground for this and the interference which Iran has today in other nations like Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Yemen is part of this operation for return of Imam Mahdi.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This theory of Mahdaviat has been studied properly and they have not taken this subject the way Shias have taken this in a mockery form. AS the Quran tells the Prophet that have you seen those who have taken their religion for mockery? It is very sad that Shias have done the same with Mahdaviat but the enemies have taken this very seriously. They have not taken Mahdaviat from orators and pulpit mongers but instead they have referred to this subject from prophet Shias sources and joined the links of events and they ascertained that Mahdaviat is the divine global political system. The crown prince said due to this reason we cannot talk to Iran instead we are ready for a war with Iran. But we will not fight the battle in other Arab countries like Bahrain, Syria, Yemen instead we will move this war inside Iran. This was his formal declaration in public on TV Channel and this person is the axis of all mischiefs in entire Middle East at present.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saudi&rsquo;s Networking inside Iran</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The day before yesterday incidents that took place in Tehran whereby two blasts and attacks happened on Iranian Parliament and Mausoleum of Imam Khomeini (r.a); around few hours before the Saudi <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_3.png" alt="" width="194" height="111" />Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir formally announced in a conference that Iran will be punished as it is not refraining from interference in other Middle Eastern countries. I am not expressing something behind the scene; all these are what is publicly announced. The Riyadh conference had only one open declaration that we will fight together against Iran and this NATO force is made against Shia. Everyone who was present there it is clear that this is not a war against terrorism and even if they say this force is made against terrorism then they specify that Hezbollah, Houthis of Yemen are terrorist and Iran is their support. They don&rsquo;t take the name of Taliban, Al Qaeda, and ISIS as terrorist groups.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The preparation of this stage was not done after the conference; it has been going on since long. Ale Saud has invested a lot of money in Iran since long for this. Iran has a good number of Sunni population and the border areas is dominated by Sunni majority. The border in south that is Khuzestan, then in West which is Sistan, Balochistan and then the northern borders of Kurdistan are Sunni inhabited areas. In these areas since several years Saudi has invested heavily under various titles of welfare, religion, trading and these are done under the banners of NGO, organizations, welfare trusts etc. One thing Ale Saud has done is to promote population increase for Sunnis so that Sunni population should grow in Iran and reach to the level of Shiite. And to increase population needs money which has been committed by Saudi and Emirates. On the southern border of Khuzestan there are Sunni Arabs. After revolution the atmosphere in Iran between Shia and Sunni was of unity and it is the same now. But the seeds that Ale Saud plants is amongst Sunni and specifically Takfirist who are not even Sunni. This is how they have spent a lot of capital to grow Takfirism in these areas. They made various groups like first they made the group of Abdul Malik Reggi which got destroyed completely. Then they made Jaish ul Adel and carried out certain operations with few more names. These were some groups they made since long to prepare for the type of operations which happened two days back. Since Iranian leadership were aware about this they had taken all possible steps to control them and to a large extent they were successful in stopping them. But still certain elements are always present who for the sake of money or other benefits do such things. This is one act they have done to move the battle inside Iran the way the Saudi Crown prince announced in his interview.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How America Milks Saudi Cow</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/6_3.png" alt="" width="260" height="175" />Apart from this the external arrangement which they have done this is that America has a pet cow. Trump has said that we will milk this cow and then leave it in dessert after that. But Rahbar has said that they will milk the cow and then slaughter it. Trump has milked this cow completely and has made contracts of trillions of dollars by sucking out ten years of Saudi capital. He has applauded himself that no American has till now not done such deals and brought this much income to America overnight.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you remember in the last part of tenure of Obama; a bill passed in American senate that Saudi Arabia was involved in 9/11 attacks. They have made a secret report in which everything is written as to what role Saudi played in 9/11 attacks, as to what Saudi Embassy did and this report is present on internet. On the basis of this report a bill is passed that all those who got killed or injured in 9/11 can file law suits on Saudi Arabia in American courts and take compensation from Saudi Arabia against it. From that day of passing of this bill the Saudi Foreign Minister stayed in USA for 21 days. See how they have caught this big fat cow. They passed this bill and asked their people to file cases on Saudi Arabia. The immediate reaction that Saudi demonstrated on media was to declare that we will remove our seventy trillion investments from USA but this was all eye wash. That was the time when changes were about to take place in USA. Obama was leaving and Trump had not taken over formally the Presidency seat in White House. The Saudi Foreign Minister for 21 days sat there requesting for some time to meet Trump. He met Obama multiple times but Trump was not giving any time to this cow to meet. After a lot of intermediate efforts he finally met the Saudi FM and he got the Ale Saudi reigned and persuaded them to accept whatever they say. What they wanted to do was to first ask people to file cases on Saudi Arab as it has been formally proved that Saudi Arab is responsible for 9/11 and then get money out from Saudi through court cases. The same money now they took it directly from Saudi Arabia. Since Saudi money is already present in America they would under the pretext of these court cases step by step keep on freezing Saudi wealth present inside America. This is what America did with Iran whereby they put cases on Iran and made it responsible for various global incidents and in lieu of which they kept on freezing Iranian assets. Like if some American was attacked in Lebanon they made Iran responsible and against it froze Iran Assets. This way they continued this evil plan since long and till now almost 2 billion dollars of Iran they have distributed amongst American people. One American came to Tehran, he was caught for spying and then he was released; later they billed Iranians for all the trouble which this American got from Iran. The same way they want to usurp the trillions of dollars of Saudi also and in context of Saudi being terrorist you can rip them off. This was the planning for this cow, but this cow said that instead of going through courts, punishing us tell us what you want. If you want the same money we can give you like this only. They got submitted to it completely and accepted everything which America said. And the filthiest thing they did was this conference in Riyadh and this was an ugly spot on Muslims which they can never wipe off. The expiation of this sin can only be done by fifty Muslim nations if they disgrace America else this sin will not be forgiven for the disgrace which they have created for the Muslim world. This way they controlled Saudi and then they involved Israel along with America they started this new phase to move the war inside Iran.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Iran Attacks &ndash; Symbolic not terrorist</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These attacks which have taken place carry least importance for Iran but this has been given high importance globally. Inside Iran as per their political policy they are giving it least importance and it should be like this only to not make people afraid. But the reality is that these attacks are important and <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/7_3.png" alt="" width="210" height="141" />internally a lot of importance has been given to these attacks. These attacks are symbolic and have been done on two symbolic places. The targets for these attacks are both symbolic places. The mausoleum of Imam Khomeini (r.a) is the Ideological and Revolutionary center. These targets are not the ISIS targets because ISIS always targets public places to terrorize people. Though they have accepted the responsibility and Iran also said that it was ISIS. They were elemental in carrying out the operation but not planned and initiated by them. They were Iranian Kurds who were trained by ISIS. They were first part of rebellion group inside Iran in Kurdistan. They went out from them and became part of ISIS and carried out this attack.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a symbolic act which takes places in many places like in Pakistan Army GHQ was attacked. Attacking GHQ is not the target of terrorists; they attack parks, public, rallies, they only target to create terrorism. Those who target symbolic spots for attack they are not done by gangsters or terrorists; there are governments, systems behind such symbolic attacks. This attack is not beneficial to a group it is for an opponent government. When an attack is done on a place which is the symbol for that community&rsquo;s ideology, power, thinking then there are systems behind it who want to target these identities. To target symbolic spots is done under a strategy and there is definitely governments behind it. This is because rebellion groups do not gain anything out of it. These attacks are done as a message. At present a message is being delivered to Tehran that we have this much strength that we can become threat to your sacred places as well. The Parliament and Haram e Imam are both symbolic significant spots and specifically Haram e Imam.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The second point is that since 20 yrs. Iran has been complete peaceful. For ten years after revolution when the war was going on Iran was highly insecure with many incidents but after the war ended Iran made a very strong security arrangement and the result was that Iran was peaceful despite of Iran involved in Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon. This was a big message for the world about Iran&rsquo;s strength that despite of so many enemies and Iran&rsquo;s interference in several nations still Iran is not allowing anyone to do anything inside Iran. This was a big message and the actual attack was on this impression that now those peaceful days of Iran are over and there will be insecurity in Iran now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Qatar and Saudi rift</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8_1.png" alt="" width="300" height="97" />Qatar has been the target since some time for some reasons. Six countries severed relationship with Qatar and immediately started enmity with a close friend. The current Emir&rsquo;s father and in fact his mother started a new method of politics. You should keep in mind that in Qatar the power base lies with the mother of current Emir and the wife of ex Emir. The grandfather of current Emir went to Britain and she asked him to stay there and the power was given to his son; at the back was this woman. She is woman who is after heroism who wants to stay behind and play games. She is very shrewd and plays conspiracies. She decided to modernize Qatar and invested heavily in every field to make Qatar a big power in Arab. Prior to this Qatar was ignored and very small country. She changed the status and one thing which happened was that they started to rebel against Saudi Arabia. The father of current Emir previously disconnected from Saudi Arabia else all Arab nations live in accordance with Saudi.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Qatar decided to announce itself as a new political power and they were really becoming strong; and this woman was behind its progress. She transformed all the systems of Qatar for modernization. She changed economic system, trading and with agreement with USA they made an Air force for America in Qatar. Qatar at present despite of being very small become a global name and it has made a name bigger then Saudi Arabia. The next football world cup is about to be held in Qatar. Soccer World cup is the biggest sports event of the world and no one can think that this is being held in Qatar. Qatar is counted as a big name in sports like in wresting, boxing, driving though there is no Qatar national playing in these. They have purchased foreign players at multi million dollars and given them Qatar nationality. This is the desire of pomp which is there whereby they created a fame to this extent that they got nominated for hosting world cup. This is the politics that has started in Qatar whereby they want to acquire the leadership themselves and hence they have spent a lot of money in various field. The biggest Gas reserves are in Qatar and they are selling this aggressively. In the field of terrorism Qatar has spent more than Saudi. In creating ISIS, Jibhatal Nusra, Syrianliberation front and even on Muslim brotherhood whose president was Morsi; Qatar invested heavily on all of them in their pursuit of power. Qatar invests only in places of power. When they select a party also to invest they select strong parties like Hamas in Palestine, Muslim brotherhood in Egypt and even in Pakistan they invested a lot on terror groups. They have not invested this money to promote terrorism but to increase Qatar power in the world. If all these industries have Qatar investment then they will become a big power.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the reason Qatar became a threat for Saudi and started denying Saudi policy and on other hand becoming favorite of world. Even in Saudi to meet its agenda in the region Qatar was becoming an obstacle. Qatar was spoiling the games played by Mohammad bin Salman. This is the reason they have targeted Qatar and this is not their ultimate strategy and it is possible that they will come to some compromise. To carry out this sanctions on Qatar is also a message to Iran. Any country that orients a little to Iran will have to suffer. One thing that Qatar did was that they did not implement the Anti Iran policy of Saudi Arabia. Even after this conference Qatar objected that this does not makes sense to isolate Iran. In all conferences Qatar would agree to Saudi Arabia but practically they would do the opposite to Saudi Arab. This was not for sympathy with Iran but in opposition to Saudi Arabia. I remember in one meeting in Lahore, when a person was about to give his opinion he had to rush out for some emergency, someone asked him at least give your opinion. He was rushing out and pointed out to another person in the meeting and said that whatever is the opinion of this person my opinion will be opposite of that. If he says yes, then consider my opinion as No. Qatar was like this, whatever Saudi says Qatar will do its opposite and Saudi did not liked that a kid in my neighborhood has become so tall. A telephone call got leaked few years back between Egypt President and ex Qatar Emir. In which Egyptian president was telling these Saudis are fools and we should reap as much from them as possible whereas the Qatari Emir was saying that these foolish Saudi&rsquo;s will get disgraced through our hands. This became a big issue and diplomatic relations were severed but then again compromise was done.&nbsp; In regards to Iran Qatar acted opposite to Saudi policies. They remain in support of Iran and did not disconnect from Iran. In the recent conference of Trump, the Qatari Emir though he was present there but condemned that this is nonsense talk that Iran should be isolated. Now when Qatar got into trouble Iran is also supporting them. The Qatar airline now could not fly over the gulf countries but Iran has opened its Air space for them. This issue will not go forward and if it does then this would be a foolishness which they will do. Like they threw Yemen, Syria, Lebanon,and Iraq all in the hands of Iran. So if they do not resolve this issue then Qatar might also go in the hands of Iran. This issue of Qatar will not move forward because the actual goal is Iran.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proving Saudi as powerful </strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/9_1.png" alt="" width="275" height="183" />These attacks are a sign and signal that the useless forces of Saudi Arabia can also do such things. Now since Mohammad bin Salman has been sent down in the field by America to fight these battles. To give this impression that Saudi intelligence, policies, forces have become so powerful that they can target such strategic spots in the most peaceful and secure nation they have done this. If you look at the outward then this is done by Saudi as they have said they are moving the battle inside Iran. If this has been done by Saudi forces then this is very a big achievement,but the Saudi forces are not powerful to do such things with rented forces to target a spot like Haram e Imam. But this strength lies with America and specifically Israel. Israel can train other countries as it has big experience in this. Several Iranian scientists were targeted inside Iran through Iranian rebels managed by Israel.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Internal Cooperation in Iran attacks</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One more objective of this attack was to create an impression that Iran can be infiltrated. We have proven that Iran is an easy ground which we can infiltrate easily and carry out operations wherever they want. One more point I should mention here that when sacred symbolic places of a community are targeted. These sacred places like Mausoleum of Imam,<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/10_1.png" alt="" width="260" height="172" />&nbsp;Parliament, and Army HQs demonstrate the weight of a country but when such places become insecure then it weakens the power of the country and makes the entire nation insecure. To target such sacred symbolic places it is impossible for any other country to do this unless there is cooperation from inside. And this cooperation is not from ordinary people it is from special class. Like the attack on GHQ was not done with cooperation of people but was done with cooperation from people sitting inside GHQ. If there is an attack on the symbolic spot of army then there is cooperation from inside army to make this happen. It is not appropriate for Iranian policy to issue such statement but it is a fact that approaching these two sacred spots is done through internal cooperation. This is the biggest threat for Iran. Not that ISIS has come inside Iran which is insignificant as the Supreme Leader also has said that these were simple fireworks for us since he has trust on the system and there is no need to be afraid. But this is of concern that without internal cooperation and infiltration this operation cannot take place. And the Supremeleader has been making the people attentive since long. He has been saying that American objective is to infiltrate inside diplomatic layers of Iran and governmental and other organizations. Many affairs that are taking place inside Iran are due to this joint cooperation betweenexternal and internal elements. The enemies of revolution outside and the power worshippers inside. The external enemies take advantage of these power hungry elements and they both try to gain personally from each other.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Supreme Leaders calls on students to take control in their hands</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/11.png" alt="" width="230" height="155" />The Supreme Leader day before yesterday in a gathering with the University students made a very important point. This was on the same day when this incident happened hence it was natural that the leader of the state should deliver his entire speech on this incident but he hardly made one or two comments on this incident. His entire speech went on internal issues and during this speech he issued a unique message to the students which till date he has not done. The leader gave an example and expressed what the actual issues of the country are and what various organizations are doing. Amongst them one organization about which the leader quoted was Ministry of Culture and Broadcast. In Iran in past there used to be an Orator who recited a specific Dua on TV channel in a very rhythmic manner and for several years this persons recitation was broadcasted on the TV channels. His name is Shajarian and later he became Anti revolution on which his recitation was banned from being broadcasted. The Minister of this entity wrote a letter to the TV station that at the time of Seher and Iftar this person&rsquo;s recitation should be broadcasted. The Leader said look at this useless work of this Minister; what kind of issues the nation is going through and what this character is raising as an issue. Is this the issue of the nation as to which Zakirs recitation should be broadcasted and which not? We have made you the Minister for this? The actual subjects of Ministry of culture was to rectify the issues of religiousness, Hijab, Youths and this is where the Leader made an address to the students with a war interpretation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since he was the commander before and now also he is the commander in chief of the forces but he hardly uses warfare language. But this time he used the war language and addressed the students saying that in this Soft War. The Soft war is the cultural war and these students are the officers of this war and they have to fight this Soft war. Then he said that during war if the Headquarter becomes a victim of some crisis, and the communication between the field and HQ breaks, or the HQ is bombed or the commanders run away, sleep or become careless; then in this situation there is a policy of war. That policy is that the soldiers get the rights to fire themselves; since your contact with commander and HQ is disconnected for whatever reason then the soldiers should not return back since there is no one to give them order; then these soldiers are the commanders and they don&rsquo;t need anyone to give command. They themselves take control of situation. Now the leader has openly given this message under these crisis to these Iranian youths that at this stage you have lost contact with your commander and now you have the authority to fire on your own. The Leader himself is present but he is asking the people to stand and fight themselves. This proves that there is a big danger from inside. On the same day when there were attacks on Iran the American congress has passed a new Bill of sanctions on Iran. These two were done together. It shows that there is an internal coordination also there. Since the leadership is alert, experienced and has very high experience on handling crisis he knows how to take the nation out of this crisis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to mention this point that this Saudi cow is acting in a big foolish way like a cow only. They are cow of Trump and are really foolish. To isolate Qatar is in favor of Saudi; attacking Yemen is like attacking villagers but for Iran they are fools. Iran is having a powerful army and they have very high experience in fighting war and no one has fought such prolonged battles which Iran is fighting in these last 70 years. There is no army in the world who is having such practical experience which Iran has. Iran has the maximum counter terrorism experience. That army which has made Israel bite the teeth. That force which has cleansed ISIS from Syria, Iraq and has made such a powerful system in Hezbollah is very powerful. They have their own war machinery and no need to take support from outside. Trump has intentionally aroused this Cow which was about to happen in Siffeen but did not happen. Ameerul Momineen (a.s) told Muwaiya that let us not make our forces fight, let us fight with each other alone. The advisor of Muwaiya, Amr Aas said this is a good opportunity you should go, fight and defeat Ali. Muwaiya stared at Amr Aas and said you want me to go in front of Ali? I know what is going on in your mind. Is there any possibility to escape Ali&rsquo;s sword? He was clever and did not do. These Saudis are all followers of Muwaiya but here they have done this foolish act to come in direct confrontation with Ali. They are confronting a force that has all forms of war experience like psychological warfare, classical war, strategic war, guerrilla war, they have air force, navy and to go and confront this army is suicide. Trump has pushed this cow in the battlefield to see how it gets shredded to pieces. The day this cow takes the first step that would be its last step. There is no formality in this; the first day Ale Saud starts the war and on that day itself this war will end and Ale Saud will be destroyed. But the loss that the Muslim Ummah will suffer will be very high. Iran has till now avoided this and it looks like now also they will avoid this direct confrontation. Iranians are certain that this has been done by Saudi and America but they have issued formal statement that this has been done by ISIS. Everyone knows that this technique of attack is only with America and Israel but Iran wants to avoid this. They don&rsquo;t want to start this war. The more they avoid this war it is better because there is a big destruction of Ummah. Anyone who wins this war will also lose it because the damage done to the Muslim Ummah would be very severe. This would be war between Muslims. The Iranian leadership is demonstrating extreme patience, deep insight and in matured form but on the other hand there is extreme foolishness. We pray that May Allah relieve the Muslim Ummah from this sedition.&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15132481791513148476top.png', '', '1513148476Iran_Attack_Analysis.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:32:38', 'Y');

He is a young corrupt, transgressing prince and those things which others from Ale Saud could not do he has committed that I will do that. The Satan&rsquo;s wanted since long to create a big sedition amongst Muslims and wanted to create a last big encounter. They would put pressure on Ale Saud and they were doing this indirectly by investing in Pakistan and creating ISIS. But after failure in this way now they have made a Takfirist force of 39 countries which will fight for Takfirist Ideology according to which all others are infidels and specifically Shias. They have only target that is Shias. They want to confront Shias and finish them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_4.png" alt="" width="325" height="218" />Mohammad bin Salman issued statement on Al Arabia TV and entire world published it whereby in front of everyone on TV said all this. When he was questioned whether are you ready to get into dialogues with Iran to resolve this. He said we can never get into dialogue with Iran and the reason is because Iran has a particular Ideology due to which we can never talk to Iran. That Ideology is of Mahdaviat and Iranians believe in reappearance of Imam Mahdi whereby he will dominate the world and a global system of Imamat will be established. Iranian also want to prepare the ground for the return of Imam Mahdi and what Iran is doing in the region is the same and this what Iran is doing is a big challenge is their preparation of Imam Mahdi who will come and rule the world. This is something we will not allow to happen and make Iran reach this purpose. He openly said that there will be a battle and it will not be in Saudi Arabia but in Iran. We will start this battle inside Iran. Now some others are trying to give various interpretations but He has openly given this statement that this is a battle. And as I said before in Yemen they were preparing for this encounter.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_4.png" alt="" width="300" height="173" />The 39 countries alliance force which they are preparing was also clarified for what purpose he is doing that. This force in which Pakistan is also involved and though we have no hopes from the current rulers and politicians that they will not become part of this sedition. This is because whatever they have received from Ale Saud is showing its effects but the Pakistani community should be aware about the stupidity done before by General Zia ul Haqq which has resulted into destruction from all aspects. Now they are starting to do another stupidity and this will be damaging for the entire Muslim Nation. Iran does not wants this battle to take place either in Saudi or in Iran.&nbsp; Saudi wants to give this battle the color of Shia Sunni using the card of Haramain. Saudi is buying out forces from the across the world but this is a stupidity and insane acts. Mohammad bin Salman has started to coordinate with Western nations also and since the system in Iran is not tolerated by anyone they are willing to cooperate with Ale Saud. He has said this that we have made many attempts to displace Iran but all have been unsuccessful. They have made Saddam fight with Iran, sanctioned Iran, got the oil prices down but all have failed and till the time Iran has this vision of Mahdaviat Iran will keep on intervening in regional affairs. This fight has to happen inside Iran. Iran as a reply has written letters to United Nations. This is a deception of Satan and this drunken Prince does not know the system which he wants to demolish is the system of Allah; he does not know that the protector of this system are not Iranians but the essence of Allah. He did not know that if this system had to eradicate then it would have happened in Tabas. When with full preparation they came to Tabas and then a strong sand storm came which destroyed them. From there itself he should know that the protector of this system is not Iranians but Allah. This battle will not be with Iran but with Allah. If you could win this battle then Bani Umayyah, Bani Abbas could have destroyed this vision. Their problem was also with this vision only. This vision, Ideology which Shias know less but the enemies know more and today they have openly expressed it. Some enemies are clever that they do not come on TV and say that we are enemies of Mahdaviat. But this prince is a fool that he came on TV and expressed it that our enmity is with Mahdaviat and till the time this vision is present with Iran this region will not remain safe. He has this fear that if the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s) happens, then it will be from Mecca and Ale Saud power will also be gone. Hence this fool in order to secure their power wants to stop the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s).&nbsp; It is there in all Muslims books and beliefs; for both Sunnis and Shias. The difference with Ahle Sunnah is that he will be born in the last era whereas Shias believe that he is born and under occultation. This is an established ideology for all Muslims except this Najdi group that Imam Mahdi will come and establish a global governance. In the past the followers of Imam had this belief that the return of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s) is near but it looks like now even the enemies are as well able to see the signs of reappearance. They have gathered 39 forces, rental armies to stop reappearance. The reappearance is of that person who is appointed by <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_4.png" alt="" width="280" height="159" />Allah who will remove evils from this land and establish the rule of Allah. Imam Khomeini (r.a) was a disciple of this Ideology and you have put all efforts but could not move back Imam Khomeini even by an inch from this stand. When you could not do anything to Imam Khomeini (r.a) and now you have come to fight against Imam Mahdi. The issue of reappearance of Imam Mahdi is not an Iranian matter, it is an Islamic issue and anyone confronting this is standing against Islam and this is where Pakistanis need to think a lot. Now when they have expressed their intentions then Pakistanis should think in which direction they want to take us. They have high hopes with Pakistani because they have seen this with the gravity of terrorism in Pakistan. They believe that the reappearance of Imam Mahdi can be stopped by Pakistani if we rent them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistani would be god willing from the army of Imam Mahdi and not in the army of enemies. This community will not become part of any such Fitnah. Those who have sold themselves will do but the Pakistani Muslims will never do this. The Ale Saud will take some initial stupid steps but they have not estimated the strength of the system which they are confronting. The same example of Tabas which I have given. When American forces landed and became victim of Sand storm. At that time Jimmy Carter was the President of America and had hatred towards Iran because all this happened in his tenure. When he got this news, he was sitting in control room and he cried; tears came out when he got news. While crying he said that looks like God is also with Khomeini. When enemy also witnesses that Allah is with Khomeini then everyone should understand that Allah has protected this system and revolution then today also Allah will protect this system from this Fitnah as well. This is a fitnah to make Muslims fight amongst each other. They have sold big weapons, trained them so that Muslims should become victims of each other. But we have seen this is last 40 yrs. that the leadership of this revolution has demonstrated the peak of insights aginst all crisis, whether internal or external.&nbsp; The leadership of Revolution has made revolution<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_4.png" alt="" width="225" height="151" /> victorious and this sedition will also fail with the vision and strategy of Supreme Leader and these enemies will suffer for what they are planning. The statement of Hamas is also from this perspective that the alliance which is going to happen in the region they want resistance organization like Hamas also to join them. They have announced that in June there will be an understanding agreement done between Arabs and Israel. They want to make this fitnah practical but they will not be successful. The way Supreme Leader replied to the Israeli President when he said now the Nuclear Agreement is done and we will remain in peace for 25 years; the leader replied that God willing Israel will not see twenty years. Israel will not survive for 25 years and will get annihilated. The insight with which the Supreme Leader has protected the Islamic nations from all forms of crisis here also his deep insight will come up and this accursed family will get destroyed in this sedition also an entire Muslim Ummah will get protected from the evils of this family.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1513311819MBS-Mahdaviat.jpg', '', '1513260736MBS_fight_against_Mahdaviat.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:32:01', 'Y'),

This is an announcement of a global Intifada against all oppressors, tyrants, usurpers. This day is coming on next Friday and it is an order of Imam and Wali e Amr that all Muslims, believers on the last day of Friday should raise their voice against the Pharaoh of this era, for the support of Palestine and Masjid Al Aqsa. They should all come out together in unity with one voice for Palestinian and be united with Qod&rsquo;s, pledge with Allah to prove yourself as one united Ummah. In this event all believers wherever they are should participate. Every year this day comes and many do not attend considering this is geographical, national, Arab and Iranian issue. Even in the month of Ramadhan their hearts do not become tender. This is extreme cruelty of heart that even in Ramadhan their hearts do not become soft to come out to raise their voice for the oppressed and there is no room for oppressed in their hearts despite of fasting, reciting Quran, supplications, reciting Taraweeh, mourning in Laylatul Qadr&nbsp; for Ali, then what have you done in the month of Ramadhan? Even if this much tenderness has not developed in your heart to come out in obedience of your leader; raise your voice for oppressed and to rise in the way of Allah. If we cannot do even this much then this means we have been deprived and have observed only starvation and nothing else. This is because heart is hard the way it was before. We should seek refuge from Allah. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and Imams say, that O Allah I seek refuge to you from that heart which is not humble, that self which is deviant and its desires do not get fulfilled. Seek refuge from such self and such knowledge that has made you strange to religion and its obligations. It is necessary<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_5.png" alt="" width="310" height="207" /> for the entire Ummah. If on the day of Qod&rsquo;s you cannot arrange for a rally due to administration issue or less number of believer then at least deliver the Friday sermon on Qod&rsquo;s and at least join your voices in the favor of oppressed. This is the least step that can be take on the day of Qod&rsquo;s on last Friday. Since this is the command of Wali e Amr, then even those who are under Aitekaaf can join it and still they remain under Aitekaaf provided that they don&rsquo;t step inside worldly affairs. There also their attention should be towards Allah and they are delivering their obligations.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At this stage, this year&rsquo;s Qod&rsquo;s carries high importance because the alliance of entire Infidelity has come out against Faith. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) has said that entire Infidelity has come against Faith. Today if we see the entire infidelity has undressed themselves, the name sake leaders of Muslim nations, the cruel, filthy Ale Saud have openly come out in the field with the name that they have come out against Mahdaviat. They have joined hands with Israel, Zionist to isolate Shiite. How can they isolate Shiite when Allah is with them? Their ancestors Abu Jahal, Abu Lahab, Abu Sufyan sanctioned the Prophet, fought wars with the Prophet but where they successful in doing this? Why don&rsquo;t they learn lessons from their elders than? Those with whom Allah is there cannot be isolated? The entire infidelity has come together in confrontation. If today Ali would have been there, what would these Malangs do? Just dance? Or they should come out in obedience to Ali? Today coming out against these forces of infidelity is obedience to Ali.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_5.png" alt="" width="340" height="193" />These total Infidelity of West, Hebrews and this garbage of Muslim lands that gathered in Riyadh conference where there was only one agenda that is Iran. Why? Because they are Shia and believe in Mahdaviat. The next stages of that Fitnah that came out was in Qatar, then Bahrain and now America has issued new sanctions on Iran as to why you make missiles, why you support Palestine. Another thing that happened that yesterday around 26 Bahraini citizenships were revoked, they have issued statements of imprisonment for some. There are protests going on in Bahrain and this is entire Infidelity that has come in confrontation of Shiite.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In this situation the character of Ali is not that you just sit and mourn for Ali, then thinking that we have delivered our responsibility and Ali will do everything else on his own alone; or they keep Ali this much isolated that he gets martyred and then keep on visiting his shrine. Leave Hussain alone to this extent that he gets martyred in oppressed state and then we will visit with caravans there. Leave your Imam alone, isolated in the vicinity of Kufr, Munafiq that he gets killed then I will deliver my rights by doing pilgrimage of his shrine. Ali did not leave the Prophet alone to wait for him to get killed then I will sit for my life on his grave. Ameerul Momineen (a.s) did not leave the Prophet alone for a single moment. When in Battle of Khandaq, Amr bin Abdawud came across the trench and challenged the Muslims. That time the Prophet in angered manner said who will shut the mouth of this dog. He repeated three times and three times Ali stood up. When Ali went to the battlefield, the Prophet entire faith is going against Infidelity. There is entire Kufr there and this one has come alone. This is total faith that is this personality. Today when entire Kufr is out then the one who is out in the field is total faith. Hence this day means a lot for the entire Muslim world. Today Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, Lebanon are all oppressed and even Kashmir. There is peak of oppression ongoing in Kashmir. Palestine is oppressed. First there was one Palestine but today you see across the Muslim world there are several places where Muslims are in worst state than Palestinians. The Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar are in worst state then Palestinians. The oppression that has been done on Myanmar. The voice that is raised on the Day of Qod&rsquo;s is for all Muslims. This is the voice for Kashmir, Myanmar, voice for Yemen, Iraq and is the voice of every oppressed raised by his supporter. As per Allama Iqbal</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><em>Nikli to labe Iqbal se hai na Janiya hai ye kiski sada<br /> </em></strong><em>This song has come out from the lips of Iqbal but don&rsquo;t know whose words are these</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This voice, pleading that comes out from your tongues, lips for the oppressed is liked by Allah a lot. This expression is liked by Allah a lot. Today all these facts and the Satanic games that are played in Middle East then this is the only way left with Muslims to come out on such days and raise your voice against these tyrants. May Allah give relief to the oppressed from these tyrant? We pray to Allah in this holy month and days to forgive our sins.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'Y', '1513312361Quds.jpg', '', '1513312361Qods_Day_Message_-_2017.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:30:14', 'Y'),

I don&rsquo;t know if someone has understood that or not but at least Shia should have understood. The news was that the leader of Ismaili Sect has completed his sixty years of leadership (Imamat) and they have celebrated the Golden Jubilee. The entire world and Pakistan has congratulated him for completely sixty years of his leadership. There were celebrations done and even the title in the news was of Imamat. This is a very important point specifically for the Shia Ithna Ashari that they were one of the branches of Shias only and there are various views on this. This branch started from the era of Imam Sadiq (a.s) whereby his elder son Ismael ibn Jafar who was thirty years elder than Moosa ibn Jafar. As per some historians first the Imamat of Ismael was announced and then later changed. This change is used in Ilm-e-Kalam under the subject of Bad&rsquo;aa and this topic of Bad&rsquo;aa is also confusion for scholars. Two topics of Bad&rsquo;aa and Rajat are of confusion even for scholars and there is a need that some expert scholar comes up, does research and presents this topic to common masses to their level of understanding. Bad&rsquo;aa means there was one intention done and then that is changed to something else. In some books of Ilm e Kalam the example given to explain Bad&rsquo;aa is this only that first Ismael was appointed as Imam and then changed and this needs research. Though Ismael passed away during the lifetime of Imam Sadiq (a.s) and he himself buried him hence there should be no doubt about.&nbsp; This sect after the martyrdom of Imam Sadiq (a.s) declared Ismael as the Imam e Gaib (occultation) and the sect of Waqfia came up here only that Imamat has ended.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There was one son of Ismael ibn jafar who was Mohammad ibn Jafar who also declared his own Imamat. Here division happened; one group believed in Imamat of Ismael ibn Jafar and other in the Imamat of Mohammad ibn Ismael. Then in the same manner this went on and various groups were formed. From the second century of Hijri calendar this sect started and has continued till now. Those who believed in the Imamat of Ismael ibn jafar for them Imamat ended there but those who believed in the Imamat of Mohammed ibn Ismael for them it is continuing. Imams will keep on coming from this genealogy. Then various sects came up in this chain and the last name since last 150 years for which they are known as is Agha Khani. This because one of their Imams was from Iran whose name was Agha Khan. His children are also Agha Khan and his followers are Agha Khani. This current Imam, Kareem Agha Khan is the third generation of Agha khan who was his grandfather. They are the same Ismaili who believe in the continuance from Imamat. By belief they say that Imamat is appointed by Allah and the Imam who passes away appoints another Imam as per the will of Allah. They have a complete system of Imamat and have a big infrastructure. Historically this sect has been very interesting whereby they have governed certain regions like Egypt, Africa for several decades like 150 to 200 yrs. in the name of Khalifa e Fatimi. At that time their name was not Agha Khani and now they are known as Agha Khani. They have many other sects like Bohra. They have governed Egypt, Iran, Africa, Central Asia, and India and for several decades they kept on governance and they took over many regions from Abbasids. Both Shia and Sunnis have different views about them; some consider them as Muslims whereas some don&rsquo;t and even consider them as infidels. One thing that is well established about them is that they don&rsquo;t believe in the established precepts of religion; their religion is all the inward aspects (Batin). They interpret everything on their own. They do not consider Salaat the way we consider, they consider it as supplication. They interpret Fasting, Hajj in their own manner. They do not believe on any rituals of religion and interpret them in their own way. They do not promote their sect and now they are celebrating the golden Jubilee for their Imam.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The point to be pondered over here is that they are also sequence of Imamat only and at one point they separated and made their own sect. This has happened in history on several occasions, like the Zaidi sect separated on fourth Imam. Similarly the sect of Qaisaniah believed in Imamat of Mohammed Ibn Hanafia after third Imam of Shias and for a long time Amir Mukhtar and his followers belonged to this sect and did not accept Imam Zainul Abideen as their Imam. These sects went on and Abbasids, governments played important roles whereby many sects were made and destroyed. But this Ismaili sect went on and is existing till now. The advertisement that came in the news had this title of Golden Jubilee of sixty years of Imamat. This is a very important point that a group which is spread globally, believing in the system of Imamat and are celebrating Imamat. This is a very beautiful celebration though neither I am supporting them nor criticizing them. I am just presenting a mirror to our Shias that one branch of Shia who accepted Imamat, got associated with it to the extent that they governed for several centuries and even today they are associated with their Imam and their followers. If they are in Pakistan, India and they are present in twenty five countries but are all followers of one Imam, Kareem Agha Khan. What has happened for this sect is that Imamat became a system and not just remained as belief. They also have this belief of Mahdaviat but with their own interpretations. The point which is interesting, to be pondered by Ithna Ashari Shia is that we are followers of twelve Imams and we also believe in Imamat but we don&rsquo;t see any government from us Shias in history. For Ismaili, in Iran Al Amoot was their capital and they had their government under Hassan Al Saba there for 150 yrs. Then Moghuls, Changez came and destroyed their government. In Egypt and Africa Salah Uddin Ayubi toppled their government. They had a good system of education and welfare established at that time. They continued their Imamat and till date they are under the allegiance of their Imam. They are citizens of every nation where they live but are under the Imamat of their Imam.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But if we see Shiite we don&rsquo;t see the system of Imamat. This is because Shiite only considered Imamat as a belief not as a system whereas they considered Imamat as a system and continued till date. They do not have any country or a single land governed by them, but are living in various countries. Without any land they have kept their system of Imamat intact as per their school of though. According to us there are no proofs available for their Imamat, they are not correct as per our views but as per them they kept their Imamat protected and living their life under their Imam. They are one big power in the world, and it is due to this system of Imamat. Few<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_6.png" alt="" width="350" height="196" /> months before the Canadian Prime Minister took holidays and went to Paris and spent his holidays with his family in the house of Kareem Agha Khan. You can imagine from this the political influence which Agha Khan has whereby the Prime Minister of second largest country (by geography) visits his home for spending holidays. Whenever Kareem Agha Khan visits any country he is not given the status of an ordinary person; he is given the protocol of some leader of state. He visited Pakistan few times before and Zia ul Haqq himself went to receive him and army protocols were given to them. Even though we don&rsquo;t believe in them and their Imamat but they are very serious about their Imam and Imamat.&nbsp; They are serious to this extent that they got their Imamat accepted globally. Their practices are not acceptable like Kareem Agha Khan&rsquo;s daughter married a Jew and one crisis they have now is that there is no successor to him as he has no son and one who was there got deviated and not worthy of being Imam. His daughter got married to a Jew and her Nikah was recited by a Shia Ithna Ashari scholar which is also interesting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imamat which they adopted they considered that as Imamat only in history and did not change it, remained associated with it, they governed for two centuries and they made a strong set up with that and every country acknowledges them. If you see in Pakistan, one bus of theirs was attacked and in one week the terrorists were arrested, punished and the Pakistani leaders apologized to Kareem Agha Khan that this will not repeat. There are not even more than 2 million but they have big infrastructure and biggest banking systems in Pakistan are from them. The point is that even if it is a fraudulent Imamat it got established to this extent. Kareem Agha Khan has studied from Harvard American University whose syllabus itself is of King Making. This university teaches American Imamat and all the leaders of our state and Army Generals would have done at least a six months course in Harvard. I said to one student in Iran when Moen Qureshi was made as the Prime Minister who was not even a Pakistani by citizenship. He studied from Harvard University and was sent to Pakistan as Prime Minister. I told them you could have at least made one Imam E Jumah for Pakistan. Harvard&rsquo;s is the seminary of this big devil and they make leaders from there specifically for the Muslim world. The Imamat even though is not correct, they accepted it, implemented it and have been following it without any land, state globally. Agha Khani and Ismaili wherever they are; they are under their Imamat. Whereas for us Shiite we did not allow Imamat to continue; though this spell was broken by Imam Khomeini (r.a). But for us Pakistani we have replacement of Imamat as personality. Shiite gets divided and gathers around personality with all excuse of religion or politics. Today why Shiite is not affiliated, associated with one Imamat because there are personalities in opposition to the Imamat. There are personalities confronting a system. Those who get affiliated with personalities rather than system, then even if they are in majority like in Bahrain, Iraq they could not establish Imamat. If you see Iraq, Bahrain only personalities are see, not the system and similarly before the revolution you can only see personalities in Iran and not system. There were big personalities like Agha Burujerdi, an esteemed, unique personality. The Shiite were gathered around personality whereas the system was that of Imperialism. This was the point that Shia Ithna Ashari should read this advertisement carefully. They are celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Imamat and even though for us that Imamat is not valid but they have considered that very seriously. They could have celebrated his eighty years birthday but they are celebrating Imamat. And they received greetings from across the world for the celebration of Imamat. This is how they are making the world subdued to them and against them we are in several millions, with our land with majority but are being bullied by everyone in the world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In one book which I studied long time back, I don&rsquo;t remember the name of the author where he compared India and Pakistan. He says that in India system developed whereas in Pakistan personalities developed. In Pakistan as well they do not allow the system to grow but personalities grow. These big and good personalities become an obstacle later for the community.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_6.png" alt="" width="320" height="200" />Personalities if they make systems; like Imam Khomeini (r.a) could have himself become the greatest personalities of the world but he preached, taught and presented the system of Imamat to people. We have a beautiful, evidential Imamat but is there anyone in the world who would understand this system of Imamat; else the Ithna Ashari would have been celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Imamat today. If you see amongst Arabs and in Pakistan see their perception of Imamat and are sitting around whom. In this situation you are imagining the return of imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s) whereas you have not even turned towards Imamat. You are sitting around personalities and invoking Imam to return? We have to turn towards Imamat and this celebration is a mirror for us. We pray to Allah to develop his sense, awareness in entire world for Muslims so that they understand the system of Imamat. Even in Ahle Sunnah they also have an established Imamat concept in them. If you want to understand this you can read the views of Late Maulana Maudoodi and not the views of Jamaat e Islami. If<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_6.png" alt="" width="120" height="151" /> you read the thoughts and views of Maulana Maudoodi you will see Imamat everywhere. The same with Allama Iqbal you will see Imamat in his words. It is not that Imamat is sectarian it is a system which is present in all our sects. If Shiite comes out from the personalities and move towards Imamat as system then the standard of Imamat can be raised across the world. The same Mahdaviat, Imamat is what the enemy is afraid of. They want to block the path of reappearance of Imam. As it is mentioned in dua e Ahad that they consider it far but we consider it very near.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1513313520Agha-Khani.jpg', '', '1513313520Golden_Jubilee_Celebration_of_Imamat_by_Agha_Khani.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:29:31', 'Y'),

Certain countries have made alliance to eradicate the power of Shiite which is not just table talks but instead a reality and you have to take this seriously because its direction is towards Pakistan. You very well know about the strength of Shiite. At present Saudi is in panic and it considers as an insult that Shiite is spreading so much and being accepted so much and is establishing relationship with other Muslim nations. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/11_2.png" alt="" width="400" height="203" />Saudi at any cost want to confront this and behind them is Zionist and you have heard last week the statement of Saudi prince said that if Israel and Palestine fight then we will support Israel because Iran is supporting Palestinians. If Iran supports Palestine then we will support Israel. This was said by Walid bin Talal who is the richest prince of Saudi have said this and not just we will support, they are already supporting Israel which they are doing in Syria. They have only one &nbsp;objective to eradicate the strength of Shiite.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The strength of Shiite is the strength of Islam against the enemies of Islam, against satanic forces and not against Muslims. Till date everyone confesses that Iran is the only supporter of Palestine even though there are not Shia&rsquo;s in Palestine. The image of Shiite which has been propagated by Saudi and others is not the correct image. Shiite is not a sect of Islam against other sects. Shiite is the standard bearer of Islam against enemies of Islam and the standard bearer of Muslim Ummah. And now they are making all efforts to make this standard bearer fight against the Muslim Ummah. They are trying to end this strength of Shiite. Shiite was there before Islamic revolution also but they were lost even in Iran. Even if you try to find Shiite before revolution you will not find them in the field but only in some corner. Shiite was not present in either the field of knowledge or politics. It was the ritualistic Shiite which only needed ten days for their rituals for which they had the permission to observe their rituals for ten days after which they were not seen and generations passed like this. But now they have seen that these Shiite are present in the field throughout the year and they are more charged on the tenth day of Mohurrum. They are even present in those places where the enemies were not expecting them to be present. In Palestine, the Zionist only threat is from Hezbollah which is Shiite hence it has become an objective to break the back of Shiite.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/12.png" alt="" width="270" height="165" />The strength of Islam is from Shiite and the strength of Shiite is from Wilayat-e-Faqeeh. The Pakistanis should understand and realize this strength. The entire dependency of the body is on the backbone. If leg or hand breaks then also you can do a lot with broken limbs but if the backbone breaks then you cannot do anything but just lie in bed. Ummah is the skeleton, limbs and Leader, Wali e Faqeeh is the backbone. And they know that this heavy skeleton of Shiite will not be suppressed like this. We turn towards Iraq they come there, we go to Syria they come there, we go to Yemen they come in opposition, we go to Palestine they are there and we turn towards any land they come in front. We have to remove this wrestler out but how? That is to break the backbone because once that is broken then no doctor in the world can fix it. They know that the backbone of the strength of Shiite is the System of Wilayat that is Wilayat-e-Faqeeh and hence they have to eradicate this backbone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to do so they have to break this backbone which cannot be broken with fighter jets and missiles. You can see that one hand of Supreme Leader is injured in a bomb blast incident in a mosque when he was delivering a speech. At that time he was the head of Security Council. After that he remained as President and leader and you can see that even with this paralyzed hand he has become the most powerful person in the world. <strong>The backbone cannot be broken with the Takfirist army instead the backbone of Takfiri forces would be broken by the hand of our Leader. Wilayat-e-Faqeeh is the backbone of Shiite; this cannot be broken by America and Israel. This can only be broken by the MI6 force which broke the backbone of Imam Ali (a.s), Imam Hassan (a.s). </strong>Breaking the backbone of Leader means isolating him from the Ummah. This is what they did; Ali is alone after the Prophet and Imam Hassan (a.s) is isolated and alone in the battlefield. Ameerul Momineen (a.s) says in Nahjul Balagha that I looked around and found that my shoulders are broken and only two small kids are my supporter. What would I do with them? Where are others?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/13.png" alt="" width="315" height="215" />The force which MI6 has made can only break the backbone of Shiite and do treachery. They have made the Supreme Leader (Rahbar) as the target in everything. Amr ibn Aas by raising Quran with his treachery got 12000 men from Ali&rsquo;s army disconnected and they came in opposition to Ali. The Khawarij were in Ali&rsquo;s army and they wanted Ali (a.s) to repent because he has confronted the Quran and accepted arbitration. Imam (a.s) said that you imposed arbitration on me and now you want me to repent. Those who want Ali to repent is the same force which MI6 has created today and once again reviving the conspiracy and political principles of Amr ibn Aas and they want to break the backbone of Shiite. Those believers who have sense are aware about this but in Pakistan the difficulties are more because of lack of sense (Sha&rsquo;oor).&nbsp; Due to this tricksters become successful and leader gets isolated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the duty of every one of you that when enemy attacks or strikes your leader you have to defend him. In the battle of Ohud people ran away and left the Prophet (s.a.w.s) alone but you see in Karbala, when the time for prayers came the companions made themselves as shield for Imam Hussain (a.s) and the arrows pierced their body. This the achievement of the supporters of Hussain that the time one supporter was alive a single arrow could not strike Imam Hussain (a.s). They are great martyrs who did not allow a single arrow to touch Imam Hussain (a.s) till the time they were alive. Then when everyone was martyred, then Hussain was isolated and raised the call of &ldquo;Hal Min Nasir Yansurna&rdquo;.&nbsp; When the supporters were not left then Hussain was besieged by arrows. Imam Hussain (a.s) was on the horse and the number of arrows which hit him were so many that when he came down from Horse, he sat on his thighs in the Tashahud posture. Then one arrow came and hit deep inside his throat. The doyen of martyrs pulled out the arrow and along with it a fountain of blood of came out. He took the blood in his hand and started to dye his hairs. Then he raised his hand and said O Allah! What is this Ummah doing with me? Then he called and said &ldquo;Where are my lions? Those who were my shield and did not allow a single arrow to touch me&rdquo;. The companions are victorious, blessed and salutations on them because till the time they were alive they did not allow an arrow to come towards Hussain.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It would be shame on us that in our presence an arrow of tongue or an arrow of a personality goes towards our Leader (Rahbar). The arrow should first hit us, it should first pierce our chest, all the slandering and accusations should come on us and till the time we are alive those arrows should not go towards our Leader (Rahbar).</strong> This is the standard of Ansars (supporters) and companions of Hussain (a.s) whom he applauded that you are such companions who were not present before. The companions of Prophet (s.a.w.s) were present and he got hit by stone (in Ohud); Ali (a.s) got wounded in presence of his companions; Imam Hassan (a.s) had to sign the treaty in presence of his companions but Imam Hussain (a.s) did not get hurt by any arrow or stone till the time his companions were present.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present defending Wali-e-Faqeeh is equivalent to defending Shiite and Islam. Do not say both Qa&rsquo;edeen, (those who are sitting silent) and Mujahideen (crusaders) are same; Allah will be displeased with these words of yours. Do not say that they are all Mujtahid and same. This defense is obligatory on you when this personality of Supreme Leader (Ayatullah Khamenei (d.a.) has defended so much of yours. <strong>He has protected the shrines of Iraq, he has protected the shrine of Lady Zainab (s.a). He has sacrificed his big Generals in defending these shrines against these Takfiri forces. Does he not possess even this much rights that when we go for pilgrimage of Shrines we send salutation on this personality also who has given us this opportunity of doing Ziarat? </strong>Now Arbaeen will come and you will get the opportunity of doing Ziarat then think who has protected these shrines for us from the Takfiri forces. He (Rahbar) has these rights on our neck and we have to deliver these rights. Do not become unconcerned and careless people of your era. The slogan which you raise that &ldquo;I wish I was present in Karbala&rdquo; so now prove that and be counted amongst those.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'Y', '1513315442defening-leader.jpg', '', '1513315442Supreme_Leader_-_Defending_Leader_and_MI6_Force.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:28:32', 'Y');

We can say that he has said a unique thing and before also he has pointed towards this, but in such precise manner with dates he has issued this statement first time publicly. That is related to Palestine movements. In Palestine there are two groups which are resistive; one is Hamas in Gaza and other is Jihad e Islami who have not accepted Israel till date. It is also evident that their resistance is also <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_8.png" alt="" width="300" height="209" />due to their association with the System of Wilayat. The General Secretary of this group, Jihad-e-Islami Ramadan Abdullah came in the presence of Supreme leader two days back. The Leader said that after 25 years Israel will get destroyed and this corrupt pest will no more exist. This is not just a prediction because when leader says something like this it is based on the situation on ground. There is a satanic system with their leaders, and there is a divine system and its leaders where both have taken their steps and prophesized. It is like the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) during the battle of Khandaq when the companions were not able to break a rock, they called the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). He came and hit the rock with the axe and spark came out. On this first spark He said this is for victory of Rome, then on next stroke he said this is victory of Iran. The companions could not understand what He was saying as they had no means to have such success. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) was expressing the divine way and the strategy, that if you continue on this path and this strategy under which you have come to the battle of Khandaq, whereby it is a battle of Ahzab where all enemy groups all unitedly came together to fight against Muslims were less and weak. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) demonstrated them one strategy that this is the only way to defeat them. If the minority adopts this path of perseverance, patience then these will dominate the entire world. This is the insight which the Supreme Leader has mentioned that Israel will not remain on this earth for 25 years but with the <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_8.png" alt="" width="250" height="167" />condition that this resistance continues, if you leave it and come on negotiations then this won&rsquo;t happen. In the past also in reply to the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, when at the time of nuclear deal Netanyahu said that for 25 years Iran cannot do any nuclear activities now and we are safe from Iran. To his comment the Supreme Leader replied and said you won&rsquo;t be there for 25 years. But now the Leader has given this statement to the leader of a resistance that you should continue this path and in 25 years Israel will be non-existing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '151331577125-YEARS.jpg', '', '1513315772Supreme_Leade_-_Israel_25_yrs-.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-08-30 14:19:41', 'Y'),

The reaction that was seen against this decision was as expected that is only exchange of words from every group, category. This was a sad reaction we can say. There were only news statements and part time protests; statements of drawing room and only press conferences.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing that got manifested and came up in headlines was related to the OIC Summit. OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) is a global organization of 57 members of Islamic states made since long. It was created in the 70s when there was the governance of Bhutto. They gathered all Islamic states and had one summit in Lahore as well. The thing that became the basis of formation of this organization was the issue of Palestine. When Israel did more <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_9.png" alt="" width="180" height="256" />aggression by usurping further lands; and Arabs fought three battles with Israel and lost these battles, ended up giving up some of their lands as well. The Eastern part of Jerusalem (which Muslims call as Baitul Muqaddas) was previously with Muslims under the guardianship of Jordan whereas Western Jerusalem was under captivity of Israel.&nbsp; The Eastern part which had holy shrines and Masjid Al Aqsa. The United Nations gave this situation a legal status that Eastern Jerusalem is with Jordan and Western remains with Israel. The Masjid Aqsa is in the Eastern part that was with Muslims. Israel in 1967 attacked and captured the Eastern part of Jerusalem as well and made its part. In reaction to this and some other incidents that happened with Israel some big leaders of Islamic states formed this organization at that time. From the time this organization came into existence we cannot see one effective or good step taken for the Muslims. We cannot see any success from OIC or we can say they were successful in resolving some war between two countries and solve their problems; or they have taken some steps for development of Islamic states; or some steps of pressurizing Western nations; or they have raised any voice in UN for Muslims. This was just a useless structure that was made and they do this Summit every year. In the past they had some discussions which used to come in news but now they have become so useless that no one even sees their name.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The current step which Trump has taken to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US Embassy to Jerusalem; in reaction to this a Summit of OIC members was done in Turkey. Turkey is the head of OIC and this leadership keeps on moving over few years and at the present Turkey is the head. This summit took place under the chairmanship of Erdogan in Turkey. It would have been good if this summit would not have taken place because the message which this Summit has given is very painful. First of all there are 57 members of OIC and only the heads of 22 states attended like from Pakistan the Foreign minister<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_8.png" alt="" width="330" height="167" /> went and from Iran the President attended. The Arab nations have demonstrated the peak of disgrace and absence of self-respect in this summit. The Arab rulers were as such disgraceful but the humiliation which they are showing now was not that much before. Palestine became Israel due to the disgrace and lack of self-respect of Arab rulers. It was their lack of self-honor that the first Qiblah of Muslims went in the hands of Israel and it is due to Arab ruler&rsquo;s lack of zeal, shamelessness that Israel was able to occupy part of Egypt, Jordan, Beirut and Syria. This is the height of shamelessness but in the current situation the humiliation was the worst. Some heads of Arab states attended this but only to make this summit a failure. The head of states of some countries and representatives, Ministers of foreign affairs of some others attended this summit but without any results they came out. They just ate good food there and returned back. They did a formality by issuing a response statement because Trump has done an aggression so we have also given a reply by issues a statement. They signed a resolution at the end of the summit and in which they mentioned that Jerusalem should be considered as the capital of Palestine. This is dubious statement they issued and not direct that Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump at this stage has taken a step to declare Jerusalem the capital of Palestine and this was the best opportunity for Trump. Some journalists and political analysts are saying that it was not the appropriate time for Trump to do this and this was a foolishness he did. It is not true and in fact it was the most appropriate time when he took this step for his benefits. He has taken this step when the Arabs are falling in the deepest pit of disgrace and in order to preserve their illegitimate power, authority are dependent on America and submitted to America. This is a fact that if America leaves them on their own for some time they will get destroyed. Obama at the end of his tenure said that <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_7.png" alt="" width="250" height="168" />we are spending a lot on preserving the Arabs and we will not do this anymore. Trump also in the beginning of his Presidency told them that we will not take the burden of protecting Arabs and they should spend and make their own arrangements. They used to say that Arabs are a burden on us but Trump transformed this into a beneficial deal and even said that Saudi Arab is a big fat milking cow for us then why should we not milk it. He converted this burden into a means of income. He acquired billions from these Arabs and against that he gave protection to their illegitimate power. This illegitimate power which they had would get destroyed by their own people, or with their involvement in regional conflicts or the conflicts between their own royal family members. At the end the time for their destruction has come and America has become their last support.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In this situation Trump has done two big things. Those who want to preserve their false, illegitimate power are generally very weak. Like one thing which you listen very often these days that some people make illegal pictures, films of certain personalities in vulgar scenes and then they blackmail them to pay ransom else we will publish these films and defame you across the world. These corrupt persons then do other crimes to pay the ransom to these blackmailers and avoid these films of theirs to be not published and shown to others. At times these blackmailers take money and as well publish their pictures also; thus humiliate them as well. Trump has adopted the same policy with Arabs. Since these Arabs are corrupt, indecent and whatever America could not do in the past they have come in that position to do all those things due to the disgrace, shamelessness and foolishness of Arab.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">And amongst these things one big thing was to get the acceptance of Israel which was a big challenge in the last century which now has become possible for them. America had put all efforts to get Israel accepted by the entire world, the Muslim world and Arabs but it was not possible for them. On the other hand there was a plan by some Muslim states leaders that not just we will not accept the existence of Israel but instead Israel should annihilate. This was the formula of Imam Khomeini (r.a) that Israel should get annihilated. Imam (r.a) said &ldquo;Israel at any cost should get annihilated from this world of existence&rdquo;. This was the same thing mentioned by the Supreme Leader and his followers. This is one thought and on the other hand the thinking of America is to<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_5.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /> get Israel universally accepted by everyone in the world. Israel is still a victim of this factor even in the United Nations that their existence is not accepted by everyone. There are many nations who do not accept Israel and they don&rsquo;t have any diplomatic relations with Israel. A state which has no acceptance by several countries in the world goes through a lot of difficulties in various areas like trading, travel and many other things. Israel was a victim of isolation and it was America, European Union that gave the support to Israel. America&rsquo;s plan was to get Israel out of this isolation bring them in the same of rank of other nations. From here Imam (r.a) had this statement that Israel has to be annihilated. America tried for one century to get Israel accepted in the world like any other country but was not successful. Today they have come near to that success due to the shamelessness of Arabs; that too especially from Ale Saud, Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. They are most abased, lowly nations of the world. It is because of these disgraceful states that Trump has declared that Israel&rsquo;s capital should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because he can see this becoming practical now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">America always had the fear that the day they take this step a very strong reaction from the Muslim world will get developed against them. That reaction would be harmful for both America and Israel. But what has happened proves that Trump&rsquo;s policy was correct now because there was no reaction or whatever reaction was seen (this OIC) was in fact to stop this strong reaction. The pressure which was expected to be formed from the Muslim nations and atmosphere that was expected to be created was leaked with this type of reaction specifically demonstrated in the OIC summit. Instead of an Islamic aggression starting against Israel and America they called for a summit in Turkey where they sat as a formality issuing some statements and then left for home. Everywhere in the news the head of Islamic states met for this summit where they condemned America, Israel and only issued a statement in favor of Palestine. They condemned America, Israel and supported Palestine. They did not take any practical step; no country disconnected diplomatic relationships with America; no one summoned the American ambassadors; no one pondered over the trade relationship with America. These countries who gathered in this summit there are many who have relationship with Israel and have Israel Consulates in their countries like Turkey. You can see the hypocrisy of Turkey that it is calling for a conference against the decision of Trump and it is that Islamic country which formally has Israel Embassy in Turkey. Similarly Egypt and Jordan have relationship with Israel. They as such fools and insane.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Erdogan is an astonishing trickster and deceptive person. In this week only you can refer to news agencies when he is calling for an OIC summit at the same time he has a done big trade contract with Israel. On one side the head of Islamic states gathered in Turkey for this summit to condemn Israel and at the same Turkish delegation went to Israel to carry out a trade pact which they did for billions of dollars. Saudi Arab, Qatar have proper relationship with Israel which is not just formally announced but the delegations from both sides visit each other. Last week the Israeli Army commander in chief issued this statement that when it comes to animosity with Iran; both Israel and Saudi Arab are one and we will jointly confront Iran. This week the Israeli Minister of Intelligence formally invited the Saudi commander to visit Israel and he also said the Saudi should invite the Israeli commander and this will happen. When Arabs and Mohammed bin Salman are ready for every disgraceful thing then America is acquiring the charges for their support. This is the cost which they have to pay for the support from America. Egypt, Saudi Arab and GCC countries were taken into confidence before doing this. He had full expectation that no reaction will come. This is the state of rulers who went to the summit just for exchange of some words.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Iran is the only nation who is against Israel with severity. In this conference the head of Islamic states did one filthier thing. They made the resolution in such a way that they formally accepted the existence of Israel in this summit in Istanbul. They gathered in Istanbul in favor of Palestine, to condemn Israel and instead of supporting Palestine they accepted the existence of Israel. The way did was that they wrote in the resolution that Eastern Jerusalem should be the capital of Palestine and Western Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel. They accepted the Israeli state in Istanbul. Till date there is no Israeli embassy in Pakistan and many other countries; though behind the veil there are relationships but on the outward there is nothing. This is the ground that is being prepared now for global acceptance of Israel. The result that will come out will be that one part of Jerusalem rights will be given to Muslims, that is Palestine and all other parts will be handed over to Israel. The Muslims will be get contented and Europe, America, Arab states and Israel will also be satisfied with this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/6_4.png" alt="" width="250" height="176" />The actual thing which happened was when Trump returned to America after visiting Saudi Arabia. He addressed American public and said that you have wasted American money in last ten years in Afghanistan, Syria and Arab nations by sending your forces there. You have destroyed the public tax wealth by spending them in these countries. He even presented the figures on how much was spent by America in these occupations and battles in Middle East. This was his first visit after becoming the President in which he visited three countries. He first came to Saudi Arabia, then he went to Israel and then Vatican City. One was the center of Muslims, one of Jews and one of Christians. This was the first Presidential visit which he did to these places which we can say that places of sanctities. One has Jerusalem which is sacred for all divine religions; the Vatican City is sacred place for Catholics and Saudi Arabia has Mecca, Medina which are sacred for Muslims; and Trump visited these three countries. This was the beginning of this global politics and it was a highly meaningful journey for him. He decided everything in this trip as to what is to be done with Iran, in other states; what is to be done with Qatar. He returned back and delivered this speech that you have done so much loss in ten years and I have got these many billions of dollars in one night from this cow. Do you have any example before that any America President has earned this much from anywhere overnight? He took full advantage of the disgracefulness of Arabs. There were fifty nations gathered there and Iran was not there in that visit. In Istanbul Iran also went.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When the delegation of Iran returned back they issued a statement as to what astonishing thing happened there. At times diplomats do not realize in such gatherings as to what they have said and what all they have accepted and what they have rejected. There is a hot environment there and then<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/7_4.png" alt="" width="270" height="154" /> later the think tanks discuss and analyze as to what they have written and signed. The same happened that later they realized that they have accidentally accepted the existence of Israel. Iran then openly announced that we are not in agreement with the resolution of Istanbul conference. The President of Iran signed it but later the Ministry of Foreign affairs said that you have done something wrong; you had gone there to deny this but eventually you accepted them. This treachery was also done during this conference. While doing the support of Palestine you ended up accepting Israel. This was another big benefit which Trump gained out of this. Trump disgraced the Arabs, as well divided them, looted their wealth and the biggest sacrilege did was that he imposed Israel on them. This was a big oppressive act that took place in this summit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you can see that in the entire world there has been only transfer of words, statement and no practical steps were taken except for few missiles which Hamas launched on Israel. Apart from this no practical steps were taken; only protests were done after Friday prayers; they broadcasted these protests on Friday and then closed the chapter of Palestine. Some leaders issue such statements as well that we have solved all the problems. There were no reactions from the masses as well apart from this routine activity of doing protests to record their some activities. Hamas has announced for a third Intifada which is an armed uprising starting against Israel.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One more conspiracy that is being cooked up is a new encounter they are about to start in Middle East. One high possibility is that they will start this in Lebanon whereby Israel wil<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8_2.png" alt="" width="265" height="151" />l attack Lebanon that is Hezbollah; then Iran will enter in this battle to defend Hezbollah and this way they besiege Iran inside Lebanon. The other possibility is that they are gathering evidences and finding reasons to attack Iran. In other words they are trying to find refuge in a new battle. Till the time a new battle starts in Middle East the Arabs are not certain about their survival. They are thinking that they will be eradicated and only a new encounter can give them survival. In last week the new Arab NATO which was formed by Mohammed bin Salman where 43 countries are member and the Pakistan General is their chief; they had a conference. In this conference they said that Iran and Hezbollah are two big threats and we have to encounter them. They are preparing on one side and on other hand America is creating a global front against Iran to prove insecurity from Iran through their missiles, and Iran spreading insecurity in the region, Iran is interfering in the region, Iraq and supporting Hezbollah. They are trying to find all these excuses but there are no effects of this seen yet. Whatever spider games Mohammed bin Salman has made eventually he himself got trapped into it. He demanded resignation from Lebanese Prime Minister, Hariri and he gave that but after returning to Lebanon he denied that; I am not resigning and this was a fraud with me. Whatever this fool has weaved he himself got entangled in it but he is inflicting damages on the region with severity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The most dreadful thing in this entire saga is the silence of the entire Muslim Ummah as if they are not related with it. This is because all rulers are only after their own interests. Erdogan took the maximum benefit out of this. He was the cleverest one in this summit. He called this summit of 57 Islamic nations and took it for his own benefit. After the issue of coup in turkey and the panic that he created there was anxiety and doubt about Turkey at a global level. Since EU has completely isolated and they will be out from NATO, with America also it has conflicts. In the region <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/9_2.png" alt="" width="275" height="172" />also Turkey is defamed for supporting terrorists. It is also ashamed for supporting Kurds. In Iraq also he is defamed for interference. From all sides Turkey was a victim of isolation and there was anxiety about them. He called 57 countries and took protection under this problem and this was really his cleverness. This is something which everyone does who take advantage from issues. Like there are some organizations who are free and not doing anything, they just wait for some bomb blast to happen, some bodies to fall then they immediately jump on the corpses. For them the corpses are very expensive. A believer till the time who was alive was worthless and during his life if he would come to meet them, they would not meet but the same when he dies he becomes very expensive. This corpse gives them big benefits. Erdogan did the same thing from the wound that America has inflicted on Palestine. He cashed this to his favor. He called all the Islamic states and gave sharp statements like others.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Iran has a clear policy about Israel that it should be annihilated. The Supreme Leader regularly mentions this that Israel should be completed eliminated, destroyed and not that it should be only isolated and become weak. The Leader has said this also that in twenty five years this will happen. But the Iranian President has given a diplomatic statement. In the past the Iranian President&rsquo;s visiting international conference would give blunt statement that Israel should be eliminated. But this current president did not say that. At present the most revolutionary, fiery speech was of Erdogan. He was the only person who said Israel is tyrant and rest all others used diplomatic language. The Iranian President sat like a diplomat and as such he has given the name of his politics also as balanced politics. But the Supreme Leader has a clear policy that Israel has to be annihilated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present there are two clear policies about Israel; one is that Israel should be completely annihilated and other policy is to get Israel accepted. Imam Khomeini (r.a) declared the Qod&rsquo;s day as international day against Israel but the Muslims did not participate in it. There is one small possibility being presented now that due to this stupid step of Trump there will be some militancy actions. There are many armed militancy groups in many Muslim countries and they are expressing this concern that the direction of these groups would turn towards Israel. But this will not happen because the philosophy behind creation of such groups is not Israel. This is because those who made these armed groups till date have not taken steps or even issued any statement against Israel. These armed groups were made to confront Shias; they consider Shias as the biggest threat in the world. Shias are not acceptable to Arabs as well America and all these armed groups were made against Shias and they will not stand against Israel. There is only one Shia armed group that is ready for everything to be done against Israel and rest all other groups are ready against Shias. Hence it is not possible that these groups will stand against Israel. When there are battles going on in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Pakistan is disturbed and in this situation Trump taking this step which would turn the face of all these conflicts towards America and Israel seems a big foolishness. Trump has assured and is contented that this will not happen because they have made these groups themselves. Trump has openly mentioned in his Presidency campaign speeches and even after elections that ISIS was made by Obama and Hilary Clinton. Hilary Clinton was the Foreign Minister of Obama and she has written in her book that we have made ISIS. It was the need and hence we did this. Those groups which is made by America and Arab wealth will never fight against Israel. In Syria there are dangerous armed groups present but they have not even fired a blind bullet on Israel. The forces that are prepared for confronting Shias will not take a single step towards Israel. The promise of Allah that Israel will get annihilated will be fulfilled and this honor, prestige will be given by Allah to the standard bearer of Islam and they are Shias who will be honored with this. The way before the fortress of Jews was ruined by the Imam of Shias and this era fortress of Jews will also get destroyed by the followers of Ali (a.s) God willing. This will not get destroyed by Arab and followers of Trump.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1516614783test.jpg', 'Aau6MoklLUA', '1513372174Islamic_states_accepts_existence_of_Israel_in_OIC_Summit.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-22 01:53:03', 'Y'),

In June 2018 the elections are coming up and every day the country with full speed is moving towards<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/21.png" alt="" width="305" height="172" /> seditions and big difficulties. It is not happening naturally but they are pushing the country towards Fitnah&rsquo;s. All groups whether secular, religious, liberals are doing this and astonishing atmosphere is getting created. The upcoming elections would be unique elections as compared to all past elections. The tricks which are being seen whereby conflicting persons are getting allied to play games. The elections are just the name but in reality they are moving towards a civil war. These elections in Pakistan would be highly dangerous on the basis that only sectarianism preparations are being done. Religion is being used in the cruelest form for these elections. You can be attentive that the Parliamentary candidates are submitting their tickets to sages, feudal lords, scholars of all sects are coming out and every sect is coming out with full preparation in the field. You should know that the religious element is highly sensitive like a pile of explosive. You fiddle with it a little and it destroys. It has high power of destruction as compared to other elements. If religion is used and by creating sectarian environment and arousing their greed if they are brought out in the political arena then they will cut each other to pieces and also shred the nation. There is a dangerous smell that is coming from these elections. Even in any ordinary elections also there are big damages that Pakistan suffers but the upcoming elections are presenting that an inappropriate engineering is being done. For this reason there are no effects of any Middle East or international issues on Pakistan because the entire nation has been dragged into local issues. They are getting every group to come out for sit in protests on roads.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can bring them out on streets with various excuses but you will not be able to get them back inside their homes. Like in Afghanistan; Zia ul Haqq adopted a policy by arming the religious persons but he was not able to take their arms back. A much bigger foolish strategy is being adopted in the country then the strategy for Afghanistan. This is because Zia ul Haqq had made this atmosphere of arousing the religious sentiments of people for three targets; one was Afghanistan, second Kashmir and third were the Shias inside the country. But whatever is happening now has no foreign aspect or element involved. When there foreign external fronts made they give benefits to communities. Any nation that is in war with other country, though there are damages inside but people leave aside their internal conflicts and unitedly confront with the enemy of the nation. But in a nation when there is hatred amongst people, the lava is boiling, and there is no external front as well. All internal fronts are being opened that too on the basis of communism and religion. This strategy is more foolish then that of Zial ul Haqq.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is only one solution to this which is the awakening of the Pakistan people. Even if there is no awakening just remaining unconcerned at times can also give benefits. The way the Pakistanis have become unconcerned with Palestine, Israel and many other things; they are just busy in their routine lives they should become the same for elections as well. Like when Shias are killed they don&rsquo;t care. Similarly if they become carless, unconcerned from elections then also this Fitnah will not be successful. But Pakistani will never leave elections. Pakistani&rsquo;s cannot leave two things; one is Chilies other elections. Even if the entire world&rsquo;s doctors give verdicts that chilies are forbidden to eat still they will eat. The second is elections in which they will jump that too in a very bad manner. This is the danger and the solution is also this. The way they are unconcerned with many other issues which come and pass by; similar if they let these elections also pass by and don&rsquo;t get involved then a lot can be secured. The chances are very low because everyone is prepared to jump into these elections. Even the Eunuchs don&rsquo;t stay away from elections. They make party and register themselves every year. They make their candidates stand in election. This is the only field in which they are not distanced, they come in passion and they leave their profession and come in the field of politics of elections. Hence when they can do this then all others consider it as their rights to contest in elections and this is fueling the fire of Fitnah. They are arousing the Fitnah and on the other hand the people are jumping into it, specifically when it is on the basis of religion. When a person from every sect is out in the field, sitting in protests then it is not easy to control such protests. The people sitting in protests are out of control and anyone can change their course and burn the entire city. There is only one means which I have said though hopes are less. But God willing the way Allah has kept Pakistan safe from the evils inside and outside despite of our deficiencies, Allah will secure us in the future as well. And May Allah protect us the nation of Pakistan from this internal fitnah that is cooking up. We pray to Allah to grant sense to this nation.</p>', 'N', 'Y', '1513372724Pakistan_Elections_heading_towards_civil_war.jpeg', 'Us5ts-Hbd2c', '1513372725Pakistan_Elections_heading_towards_civil_war.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:26:00', 'Y'),

In last week it was the tragic incident of terrorist attack on Church in Quetta and a big number of Christians lost their lives. Balochistan has become the most inflicted region of Pakistan. There are many elements that have gathered there to make that province<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/1_11.png" alt="" width="280" height="170" /> insecure. Some are common across the country which are the terrorist groups like Sipahe Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and their branches which are present across the country. But some groups are only specific to Balochistan like the Baloch communists. Some due to their communism and then due to the ineligibility of our rulers they have made Balochistan insecure. The third element of insecurity in Balochistan is the interference of India which they have openly said that if PK interferes in our affairs then we will interfere in Balochistan and Gilgit region specifically which Indian Prime Minister and other government officials have also said and which is happening now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">First there were four groups in Balochistan; one were the non-Baloch who resided in some towns like Quetta and when this land became insecure for them many left that place and many were killed. The second group for whom the maximum insecurity was created there were Shias who suffered the most, and they are mainly the Hazara believers. Then the third group was the government security personnel that is the Police officers who became victims, then FC and other security forces who are targeted by Baloch communist. There is international support also for Balochistan. Sometime back there were Free Balochistan banners posted on Buses in Switzerland and England. It was there for few weeks like that and the agencies over there support them. One branch of this conspiracy to keep Balochistan insecure was to attack minorities and this was done now on Christians.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As I said before that despite of the operations going on against terrorism but still nothing is happening, because they don&rsquo;t touch the roots and stems; and only just chop the leaves. I have repeated this many times and should be repeated again and again so that the community gets attentive. That is the three roots of terrorism which are untouched and even nurtured and supported. The first is the Takfirist thinking, vision which declares everyone else as Kafir and to be killed. There are foreign Mubaligh&rsquo;s also outside but in PK there are big numbers of Madrasah, schools, centers who declare everyone as infidels and they kill only Muslims. These Takfirist only attack Muslims who do not believe in their sect. Their centers are present and for the sake of elections they are being strengthened further. You are catching terrorists but also supporting those who are breeding them. You are killing chickens but growing poultry farms. You will never find shortage of chicken throughout the year because the poultry farms are there, who are breeding chicken. Though millions are slaughtered but more than those are born.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The terrorists are caught, killed, hanged but still they keep on growing because the centers breeding them are present but they don&rsquo;t touch them. They cannot also touch them because they are very powerful as well and cannot put their hands on them. Now when these groups have come inside politics it is impossible someone will put reigns on them, because they become the need for the government to carry out protests, sit-ins, riots. The second is the government support, the officers they are present in many government institutes. I have mentioned this many time, it has come in media and reports have come. They don&rsquo;t touch them as well, the government members should not have any contact with terrorists and even politicians should not have any contacts with terrorism; it should be legally prohibited for them. Everyone knows as well that who belongs to which groups they belong and which politicians support them. The politicians support in getting terrorists out of prisons. A terrorist comes out of prison and politicians for their reception. There are many politicians who have pictures with the leaders of terrorists. These terrorists are those for whom Police have kept rewards for killing. They are hunted on one side and on other hand there are pictures of politicians with them. The third is the Arab wealth which has become as curse, destruction for Pakistan and as such for entire world. The Pakistanis; people, rulers are all captives of these Rials and dirhams. Till the time the Arab wealth is present this destruction will happen. They don&rsquo;t stop, neither do they want to stop them and nor do they have the courage to stop them so that this crime and tyranny ends.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For Balochistan it is not just Arab wealth there are many other elements as well and there is a need for a lot of seriousness to resolve these issues. The maximum damage done to the issues in Balochistan is by this worthless General Parvez Musharraf. He has flamed the spark that was under dust due to this arrogance and foolishness. As such all rulers of Pakistan who came were fools only but if you rank them Parvez Musharraf was the most foolish one. He has inflicted big loss and today we are paying for all that in Balochistan. The Baloch have come under rebellion, they have made various forces inside Balochistan; they get political support from inside and outside.&nbsp; But the victims at the end are either innocent people, on route pilgrims, Shias, police worker or minorities whereas those who are doing all this are safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1513943465Church.jpg', 'K30bjcK_2LE', '1513942086Insecurity_for_Balochistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:23:46', 'Y'),

The elections that are being designed are very dreadful. In these elections there are elements who will use religion, that too<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/2_10.png" alt="" width="270" height="186" /> prejudicial religion and this will be a politics of sectarianism. The sects are coming out with their identities whereas it is there in the constitution of Pakistan that you cannot demand for votes on the basis of religion and cannot fight elections. Here the secular parties also are demanding votes on the name of religion. This is because there are such innocent people who are religious as well as simpletons and through them a plan is devised for elections. Though the Election campaign has not given permission to start campaigns, registrations are not done but the aggression has already started. In this election religion will be used in a merciless manner and reactions will also be there.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like they will say that to vote so and so candidate will be like giving vote to Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and one who does not gives is Kafir and should be killed. When you keep religion as the basis of asking vote then this will happen. Every sect will come out with these slogans that to vote our candidate is like voting for Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s), companions, Lady Zahra (s.a), Imam Hussain (a.s), Ahlulbayt (a.s). They will bring the sacred personalities in the filthiest common routine state politics. This is an impure political ground in which you will bring the purest sanctities out. When you will bring this vision that one who votes for this person they are followers of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and those who don&rsquo;t are their enemies, then what will happen. Why you create such a plan, that you will give certificates of lovers and enemies. This should not be done and people should condemned; oppose such persons who bring sanctities out in the field of election politics as a tool.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This election is being designed on this basis only. In the past the slogans were bread, food, clothes, shelter for elections but now that has ended and religion has come out in the field. There are secular groups who are doing alliance with religious parties. If you see some secular groups are getting closer to religious groups supporting Taliban. Some secular groups are doing alliance with Barelvi group. What has a liberal group to do with Taliban and Barelvi?&nbsp; Secular means that there is no room for religion. When you have raised the slogan of secularism, that is irreligiousness then why you are dragging and adulterating religion and sanctities into elections. Hence this election is creating an atmosphere of war, fitnah in every street and lane. I have said this several times that only communal sense amongst people can give salvation from this sedition. If the sense amongst people is not raised then destructive situation arises which also becomes the basis of next encounter. The foundations of animosity that would get created now, the fronts that will open during elections will never close and in subsequent years these encounters will continue even without elections. These fronts will adopt another route in Mohurrum, Ramadan and will not end after elections. This is a mistake and foolishness of those who are doing this, who think that we will open this front during the elections and then we will close these fronts later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This was the mistake, crime done by Zia ul Haqq who opened the front before on one occasion but today the entire potential of Pakistan is being utilized but that front is not getting closed. Once the door is opened, it is not possible for anyone to close. In Iran as well the same happened whereby Mr. Rafsanjani opened the door of Liberalism for the development of country and to please Europe. He was assuming that the keys of revolution are with me and whenever I desire I will make the country revolutionary or liberal. He made liberal but could not make them revolutionary again. This was impossible and whosever does this disturbance cannot recover it. It is not possible that you get the people down in one front and then you tell them to change the front later. If you tell them later that elections have ended go back to your previous fronts they will not go there. When someone gets the taste of sitting on a political chair then they don&rsquo;t like any other rides.&nbsp; Politics is that donkey on which once someone sits he will never come down specifically the group of Maulana; once they sit there it will be impossible to make them stand from there.

For some time the world attention was away from this and busy in other issues; but since last few weeks the Yemen war has come on top in global headlines and the reason for this is the satanic conspiracy which America has made for Middle East and Trump is making that practical along with the insane Arabs. Trump on one hand wants to give security to Israel and for that he has to use Ale Saud and Arab rulers who are hell bent on their peak of disgracefulness.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ale Saud started this battle with Yemen and in last week on 19<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup>, 1000 days of Yemen was over which is three years. Whatever they planned for Yemen all the conspiracies of America, Israel, Arab states, alliances everything failed hundred percent. The Independent newspaper has given the analysis that Mohammed bin Salman is the most unsuccessful ruler in 2017 across the world because whatever gamble he played, he planned on the instructions of others all failed everthing inside country and outside; and amongst this was the Yemen attack.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A 1000 day resistance, courage which Yemeni&rsquo;s have demonstrated and as a memory for the 1000 days they did an attack on Riyadh the capital of Saudi. They targeted the missile attack on Qasr Al-Yamamah <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_9.png" alt="" width="260" height="174" />which is the world&rsquo;s most lavish palace of Saudi king. They fired a Scud Missile on this palace from Yemen. Saudi said that we could destroy it in air using their American Patriot defense missile system which can blast the attacking the missile before it hits the target. Even if they have really blasted and they say they foiled the attack but in reality it was a successful attack because even if they foiled it; it was just very near and above the targeted palace.&nbsp; Before this they launched one missile on Riyadh airport. That became a big issue that Iran has given this missile to Yemen and it was done by Iran. Based on that Iran, Israel, Saudi are lobbying on this basis to attack Iran. Even before that missile case was decided as to who gave that they fired another one. Since Yemen is already under siege by Saudi, they had missiles already from before from Russia. The second point is that Iran has not given missile to Yemen, they have given missile technology. They have given this technology to Hezbollah, Yemen and Palestine. This means they can themselves create missiles there with simple means. From the time they have started to develop these missiles; Saudi, Emirates are all in this range. Now there is a panic in Saudi, Israel that if these missiles are there with Yemen then that will be destruction for them. Hence they have started a secret plan also to negotiate and stop the Yemen war. The UN and others want to stop this and this battle has become sensitive for this reason that a big battle might ignite due this battle that is with Iran. Iran is trying their best to avoid a big regional conflict. I have said this before also that they are avoiding this battle but are also preparing for that. One war of 8 yrs was imposed on Iran and it came on its feet after sometime but Iran suffered for first few years. But now they will not repeat that and are prepared for any battle. On the other hand Saudi, Ale Saud are depending on Israel and America. Based on this they are excited to get into a battle with Iran. This would be a dreadful war and it will destroy everything. May Allah protect the Islamic world from this battle as it would destroy every thing. This is because Ale Saud do not even imagine due to this foolishness as to what level of destruction the war will have.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Let me point out one topic over here related to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about his past, personality and plans; and then analyze history you will find one historical personality exactly as resemblance to him. The character which can be openly seen in this person is that of Yazid ibn Muwaiya. The thoughts, personality, feelings, steps and ways are all resembling Yazid ibn Muwaiya. Yazid was young, he is also young. Yazid was inexperienced, stubborn, fool, lavish, lustful the same way Mohammed bin Salman is also. In the same days when he has caught five hundred Arab princes from Royal family and took a big compensations from them and is running schemes for cost cutting in the <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_8.png" alt="" width="275" height="157" />country; at the same time he has done two contradictory things. One is that he purchased the masterpiece painting of Leonardo Da Vinci for 450 M$ which no one could purchase because of this price. Mohammed bin Salman purchased this and placed in London Museum in the same days when there are war expenses and country is getting ruined. In the last week, he did a deal whereby he purchased the most expensive palace in France. This palace was made by Belgium King and then it was purchased by some capitalists and now no one could buy it but he has purchased it. When the country is being ruined he is indulged into lavishness. Yazid was liberal and he is also liberal. In Saudi Arabia certain things like dancing was strictly prohibited. In a country where normal things were also prohibited but now he has given permission for opening cinema halls; to women for driving cars, motor cycles, running in races, to visit stadiums and play football. Many things which were not permitted even for men he has given permission to women now. He has made dancing, singing all permissible in a liberal way like Yazid. It was a very strict Saudi where even breathing was also considered a <em>Biddah</em> but now He has invited famous global and Egyptian singers to run concerts in Riyadh and other cities. He is now arousing Saudi women as well to come out in this field and this has started since after a century in Saudi the restrictions are lifted and people want to enjoy this and they are out in the field. Similarly making mockery of everything and the same style which Yazid had he has the same style.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing that differentiated Yazid from other Bani Umayyah rulers was the historical crime which he did which was to challenge the grandson of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s); that is brutal martyrdom of Imam Hussain (a.s) and his companions. The moment he got the doze of power he challenged the grandson of Prophet (s.a.w.s) and denied religion openly. Then he insulted, sacrilege the progeny of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). This person, Mohammed bin Salman is doing the same whereby he is also challenging the progeny of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). At present the standard of this progeny is with Iran in the hands of Wali e Faqeeh he has also turned in that direction. He has also challenged Hussain ibn Ali of his era and wants to get into an encounter. This person&rsquo;s vision, thinking, personality, intentions, confrontations are exactly same as Yazid. That inexperience, foolishness, Firauniyat have all gathered and he wants the world to see one more Karbala. That Karbala took place in one<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/5_6.png" alt="" width="250" height="145" /> atmosphere, when Sayyadus Shohada (a.s) was alone with his family; and Kufa, Basra were all with government. But now that is not the situation. As Supreme Leader also said that we are not in the state of Shaeb-e-Abi Talib; we are in the state of Khyber. In Shaeb e Abu Talib the polytheists besieged the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) with his family and applied all sanctions, boycotted them. The Prophet and his companions could not do anything there but a time came when the victory was achieved over Mecca and these polytheists submitted. The Leader said we are in the state of victory of Mecca (Fath-e-Mecca) and Khyber; at present anyone who comes with wrong calculations, imaginations will be committing a grave mistake. At present the same situation is there but this person is negligent who is having the vision of creating Karbala but he is negligent that the army of Hussain is not that of 72 only and the result will also not be the same as what happened in that Karbala.&nbsp; He is a fool and his eyes and intellect is blindfolded. It is not even a month that how their force of ISIS made by 90 countries got totally perished by the same Hosseini&rsquo;s. He does not realize what this power can do. He is riding on the shoulders and banking on the support of Israel and America to start this big Fitnah in the Islamic world. This is the satanic conspiracy and Allah will destroy them in their own stratagem. May Allah destroy them in their own evil before they engulf the Muslim world into another difficulty.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1513949632Yemen-2.jpg', 'ACmMVXG13Ls', '1513948348Severity_in_Yemen_war.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:21:56', 'Y'),

There has been reaction on this across the world. The weakest reaction was from Muslims, the most disgraceful reaction was from Arabs and amongst this reaction one was from United Nations. There was a UN General Assembly gathering that took place on this case. First it was placed in UN Security Council (UNSC) and but with the special powers which America has in UNSC being a permanent member they have done Veto on it. All the other nations were against this but America alone did the Veto and not allowed the resolution to get passed. This resolution was then taken to General Assembly where this resolution got passed with a big majority. Nine countries opposed it, 34 refrained from attending and 128 passed it and asked America to not move its Embassy to Jerusalem and Jerusalem should not become the capital of Israel and should not be touched.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This was also a symbolic act even though there was a general public opinion about the world being against Israel, but this was also symbolic act because the resolutions of UN General Assembly do not carry much weightage and are not trustable, and are not obligatory to be implemented. These are just condemnation statements similar to ones issued by many nations as formality and there is no guarantee for it to be practically implemented. This means this resolution cannot stop Trump from moving his embassy to Jerusalem and making Jerusalem as capital. The UN Security Council has authority and if this resolution would have been accepted there then it would have weightage, would be implemented and Trump would have to stop his plan. The members of UN then implement this but America did not allow this to happen there</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The countries who accepted that America has done something wrong and their embassy should not be there is a deception because they all have friendly<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/4_9.png" alt="" width="275" height="155" /> relationship with Israel. This is just something done to mislead a public opinion. There are Muslim nations who have relationship with Israel. Ale Saud has confessed that we have friendly relationship and we have common roadmap with Israel. Bahraini Foreign Minister has said that till the time Iran is there Israel is not our enemy; they are friends. This means this resolution cannot get implemented because all the countries who have voted have friendly, trading relationship with Israel and they have no cooperation with Palestine but for a symbolic way they participated. The place where effective step was to be taken; that is UN Security Council there America did Veto on that to make it unsuccessful. The most effective step that is being taken is the beginning of the third Intifada against Israel in Palestine. There have been two armed uprisings (Intifada) against Israel and this would be the third one.&nbsp; The first two intifada had broken the back of Israel and this is the right solution. The Muslims should support Palestine in this so that this virus of corruption gets demolished completely from this world and entire world and Palestine gets refuge from its evil.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1513950249Resist.jpg', '-i8WRH5zKhc', '15139495473rd_Intifada.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 02:20:52', 'Y'),

ایسے استعمال کرینگے کہ مثلا کہینگے کہ فلاں امیدوار یا جماعت کو ووٹ دینا یہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کو وو ٹ دینا ہے اور جو اس کو ووٹ نہیں دیتا وہ نعوذ با اللہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کا دشمن ہے اور جو رسول اللہ ﷺ کو نہیں مانتا وہ واجب القتل ہے ۔یہ انداز ہوگا ووٹ مانگنے کا ۔جب آپ مذہب کی بنیاد پر تعصبات کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے ووٹ طلب کرینگے تو اس ووٹ کیلئے یہ بنیاد بن رہی ہے ہر فرقہ اپنے مقدسات لیکر میدان میں آئیگا کہ ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کو ووٹ دینا ہے ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ دین کو ووٹ دینا ہے ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ قرآن کو ووٹ دینا ہے ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ اہلیبیت ؑ کو ووٹ دینا ہے ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ امام حسین ؑ کو ووٹ دینا ہے ہمارے امیدوار کو ووٹ دینا یہ بی بی زہرا ؑ کو ووٹ دینا ہے۔یہ سارے مقدسات کو اٹھا کر لے آئینگے نا مقدس ترین میدان کے اندر ۔سیاست سب سے ناپلید و نامقدس میدان ہے رائج سیاست شیطانی سیاست یہ جو پاکستان کے اندر جاری ہے ۔یہ نامقدس میدان ہے مقدسات اس میدان میں اٹھاکر لاکر قربان کروگے ۔رسول اللہ ﷺ کی اور بے حرمتی کروائو گے ۔جب آپ یہ نمونہ رکھوگے کہ جس نے اس کو ووٹ دیا وہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کو ماننے والے وعاشق رسول ہیں اور جنہونے اس کو ووٹ نہیں دیا وہ دشمن رسول ہیں۔لوگوں نے تو نہیں دینے آپ کے امیدوار کو ووٹ تو کیا یہ نتیجہ لینگے کہ پاکستانی سارے رسول اللہ ﷺ کے دشمن ہیں ۔ایسا مخمصہ بناتے کیوں ہو مقدسات کو بیچ میں رکھ کر سیاست کیوں کرتے ہو کہ ایک طرف سرٹیفیکیٹ دو عاشق ہونے کا اور ایک طرف سرٹیفیکیٹ دو دشمنی کا ۔مقدسات کا اس سے کوئی تعلق نہیں ہونا چاہیئے بلکہ عوام احتجاج کریں،مذمت کریں ایسے افراد کی جو مقدسات کو سیاست میں آکر استعمال کرتے ہیں اوزار کے طور پر اور یہ الیکشن ڈیزائن ہی اسی اعتبار پر ہورہے ہیں۔پہلے ملکی ترقی یا لوگوں کے مفادات یا روٹی ،کپڑا اور مکان والی سیاست چلتی رہی ہے پاکستان میں لیکن اب وہ نعرے ختم ہوگئے ہیں اور اب ہر جماعت مقدسات کیساتھ سیکولر جماعتیں مذہبی جماعتوں کیساتھ جوڑ رہے ہیں گٹھ جوڑ ہورہا ہے ۔آپ دیکھیں کہ کچھ جماعتیں جو سیکولر جماعتیں ہیں وہ طالبان کیساتھ&nbsp; مذہبی گروہوں سے قریب ہورہے ہیں۔کچھ سیاسی جماعتیں ہیں سیکولر جماعتیں ہیں وہ دوسرے سلسلے سے بریلوی سلسلے سے آکر اتحاد کررہے ہیں جب کہ ہیں دونوں لبرل و سیکولر۔سیکولر کا معنی ہی یہ ہوتا ہے کہ غیر مذہبی سیاست یعنی اس میں مذہب ی گنجائش نہیں ہے ۔پاکستان کے سیکلولر بھی دوغلے و منافق قسم کے سیکولر ہیں۔سیکولرازم کا نعرہ لگایا تو کم از کم پابند رہو اس کے اگر بے دینی کا راستہ اختیار کرلیا ہے تو بے دینی کا الیکشن لڑو ،دین کو کیوں اس میں ملوث کرتے ہو اور مقدسات کو کیوں اس میں آلودہ کرتے ہو لاکر ۔اس لیئے یہ الیکشن گلی گلی ،کوچہ کوچہ اور گھر گھر کے اندر جنگ کی فضا اور دشمنیوں&nbsp; کی فضا بنانے جا رہے ہیں۔میں نے بارہا عرض کیا ہے کہ عوامی شعور اس فتنے سےنجات دے سکتا ہے اور عوامی شعور اگر نا بیدار ہو تو پھر تباہ کن صورتحال پیدا ہوگی اور یہ بنیاد بن جاتی ہے پھر اگلے معرکوں کیلئے مثلا اس وقت جو دشمنیوں کی بنیاد پڑیگی اور الیکشن کے دوران جو محاز کھلے گیں وہ کبھی بند نہیں ہونگے اور یہ محاز آئندہ سالوں میں بغیر الیکشن کے جاری رہینگے اور یہ عام دنوں میں محرم،صفر اور رمضان ہر جگہ میں یہ محاز دوسرا رخ اختیار کرلینگے اور محاز ختم نہیں ہونگے اور یہ غلطی ہے اور غلط فہمی ہے ان لوگوں کی جو یہ سوچ رہے ہیں کہ ہم الیکشن کے دنوں میں یہ محاز کھولینگے اور الیکشن کے بعد یہ محاز بند کردینگے یہ حماقت محض ہے کہ پہلوں نے بھی یہ حرکت کی تھی&nbsp; کہ ضیاء الحق نے بھی یہ جرم کیا تھا اور وہ محاز کبھی بند نہیں ہوسکا تھا۔آج پاکستان کی ساری توانائیاں ان محازوں کو بند کرنے میں لگی ہوئی ہیں لیکن نہیں کرسکتے۔ایک دفعہ اس طرح کا خوفناک در کھول دیا جائے تو پھر بند کرنا کسی کے بس میں نہیں ہوتا ۔ایران میں بھی ایسے ہی ہوا رفسنجانی صاحب نے انقلاب کے مقابلے میں لبرل ازم کا دروازہ کھولا ملکی ترقی کیلئے اور یورپ کو خوش کرنے کیلئے اور ان کے گمان میں یہ تھا کہ انقلاب کی چابیاں میرے پاس ہیں میں جب چاہونگا ملک کو انقلابی بنادونگا اور جب چاہونگا ملک کو لبرل بنادونگا ۔لبرل تو بنا دیا لیکن پھر انقلابی نہیں بناسکے دوبارہ۔اور نا ممکن ہے کہ یہ کام کرسکے ۔جس نے بھی یہ خرابی کی ہے دوسرا اس کا کنٹرول ختم ہوگیا ہے ۔یہ نہی ہو سکتا کہ ایک دفعہ آپ لوگوں کو ایک محاز میں اتار کر کہیں کہ اب واپس آجائو ،الیکشن اب ختم ہوگئے ہیں اب اپنی اپنی جگہوں پر واپس آجاو یہ نہیں ہوسکتا۔نہ کوئی پیر واپس گدی پر بیٹھے گا کیونکہ جب گدھی کا اس کو مزا آجائے تو پھر گدی پر نہیں بیٹھتا ہے وہ ۔وہ گدھی پر ہی بھیٹتا ہے ہمیشہ ۔سیاست وہ گدھی ہے کہ جو اس پر بیٹھ گیا وہ پھر نہیں اترتا اس سے ۔آپ اتار کر دکھائو مجھے خصوصا یہ مولانا طبقہ یہ تو جہاں بیٹھ جائے پھر نا ممکن ہے کہ ان کو وہاں سے اٹھایا جائے پھر ،یہ کیسے نکلینگے وہاں سے اس سیاست سے۔انتہائی احمقانہ ڈیزائننگ انتخابات کی ضرورتوں کے تحت ہورہی ہے ،خوفناک ہے۔اللہ تعالیٰ پاکستان کو بھی بچائے ،ملت پاکستان کو بھی بچائے اس فتنے سے اور اللہ تعالیٰ ان کو عقل و شعور دے بیداری عطا کرے تا کہ اس کا حصہ نہ بنیں۔</span></p>', 'N', 'N', '1514020801top2.jpg', '0SbUBE-2j3A', '1514020801pakistan_me_mazab.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-29 06:26:05', 'Y');

سیاست میں جوا کھیلا جو کام کیا دوسروں کی تلقین پر وہ سارا فیل ہوا اور اس میں ناکام ہوا ہر منصوبہ ملک کے اندر بھی اور باہر بھی از جملہ یمن کی جنگ بھی۔ایک ہزار دنوں کی مقاومت ،ایک ہزار دنوں کامبارزہ و دفاع اور جرات جو یمنی عوام نے دکھائی اس کے یادگار کے طور پر انہونے ایک یادگار حملہ کیا ہے ایک ہزاروے دن ۔ایک ہزارواں دن جب یمن کی جنگ کو ہوا اسی دن انہونے حملہ کیا ریاض پر ۔ریاض سعودی عرب کا دارالخلافہ ہے ان کا اور جہاں پر مرکز ہے ان کا اور حملہ بھی ان ہونے قصرِ یمامہ پر کیا ہے قصر یمامہ سعودی شاہ کا محل ہے اور پورا شہر ہے خود اور دنیا کا پر تعیش ترین محل ہے اس کے اوپر انہونے اپنا اسکڈ میزائل داغا جو یمن سے فائر کیا اور اس کے اوپر آکر گرا سعودیوں کا یہ کہنا ہے کہ ہم نے وہ راستے میں اپنا سسٹم ہے انکا دفاعی اس کے ذریعے سے انہونے اس کو ہوا میں ہی منفجر کردیا ان کے پاس امریکی سسٹم ہے میزائل روکنے کا پیٹریاٹ میزائل سسٹم ہے دفاعی نظام جو آتے ہوئے بڑے میزائل کو ہوا میں <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/223.png" alt="" width="250" height="168" />ہی جاکر اس کو منفجر کر دیتا ہے ،پھوڑ دیتا ہے اس کو وہاں پر ہی اور زمین پر نقصان نہیں ہوتا لیکن اگر انہونے پھوڑا بھی ہے تو محل کے اوپر پھوڑا ہے یعنی کامیاب حملہ تھا وہ اسکو یہ سارے ناکام حملہ کہ رہے ہیں لیکن وہ کامیاب حملہ تھا۔کیونکہ وہ یمن سے دقیق نشانے پر شاہی محل کے اوپر آیا ہے اور اگر انہونے روکا بھی ہے تو وہاں پر روکا ہے وہاں پر میزائل کا آجانا یہ یمنیوں کی بہت بڑی کامیابی ہے ۔ایک میزائل یمنیوں نے پہلے داغا تھا جو ریاض ایئرپورٹ پر فائر کیا تھا اس سے کافی مسئلہ بنا دنیا کے اندر اور سعودیوں نے الزام عائد کیا ایران کے اوپر کہ یہ ایران نے حوثیوں کو میزائل دیا ہے اور ایرانی میزائل تھا جو انہونے وہاں سے مارا ہے ۔اور اس بہانے سے اب ٹرمپ ،اسرائیل اور سعودیہ یہ تینوں ملکر اب جنگ باقاعدہ ایران کے خلاف کھولنے کا منصوبہ و ماحول بنا رہے ہیں۔ادھر ادھر ہاتھ پائوں مار رہے ہیں کہ ایران کے اوپر حملہ کیا جائے اسی وجہ سے کہ ایران نے یمن میں میزائل بھیجا ہے اور یمنیوں نے سعودی عرب پر فائر کیا ہے ۔اس سے پہلے کہ یہ فیصلہ ہوتا کہ وہ کس کا میزائل تھا ظاہر ہے کہ یمن میں پہلے سے موجود ہے اسلحہ اور ابھی سعودی عرب نے چاروں طرف سے محاصرہ کیا ہوا ہے یمن کا کہیں سے بھی رسائی نہیں ہے ایران کیسے وہاں اسلحہ پہنچا سکتا ہے ۔پہلےہی سے ان کے پاس وہاں تھا اسلحہ ڈپو۔اسکڈ میزائل روس کے بنے ہوئے ہیں کیونکہ یمن رشین بلاک میں تھا اس لیئے روس کے بنے ہوئے میزائل وہاں موجود تھے پہلے سے اور دوسرا یہ کہ ایران نے یمنیوں کو میزائل نہیں دیئے بلکہ ایران نے ان کو میزائل ٹیکنالوجی دے دی ہے ۔تین جگہ ایران نے یہ کام کیا ہے حزب اللہ کو ،یمنی مبارزین کو اور فلسطینیوں کو میزائل ٹیکنالوجی دے دی ہے ۔یہ تین ایسے ممالک ہیں جہاں پر جنگ ہے اور تینوں کو میزائل ٹیکنالوجی دے دی ہے ۔میزائل ٹیکنالوجی کا مطلب کہ یہ خود میزائل بناسکتے ہیں وہاں پر سادہ ترین وسائل سے یہ خطرناک میزائل بنا سکتے ہیں۔اور جب سے یہ میزائل پڑنے شروع ہوئے ہیں ان میزائلوں کی زد میں ہیں دبئی ،ابو ظہبی اور جتنی عرب ریاستییں ہیں اور سعودی عرب ان میزائلوں کی زد میں ہیں۔اس میزائل نے جنگ کا نقشہ بدل دیا ہے اور جتنی بوکھلاہٹ موجود ہے امریکہ میں اسرائیل میں اور عرب ملکوں میں وہ قابل توصیف نہیں ہے حد درجہ نیندیں حرام ہیں ان کی کہ یہ میزائل اگر یمنیوں کے ہاتھ لگ گئے ہیں تو وہ تو تباہی پھیلادینگے ۔اس لیئے ایک در پردہ ڈپلومیسی بھی شروع ہوگئی ہے تا کہ یمن کی اس جنگ کو روکا جائے ۔شرائط رکھتے ہیں کہ اگر یہ کام ہو تو ہم جنگ بند کرتے ہیں ادھر سے اقوام متحدہ نے دبائو ڈالا ہوا ہے ان کے اوپر اقوام متحدہ میں بعض ممالک ہیں کہ یمن کی جنگ کو روکا جائے تا کہ وہاں تباہی روکی جائے ۔یہ یمن کی جنگ اس وقت ایک بہت ہی حساس نکتے میں اس وجہ سے&nbsp;

There have been extremely important issues that have taken place and the most memorable thing that has happened in 2017 by the grace of Allah is the annihilation of the sedition (Fitnah) of ISIS. The end of theirs is also is in context to the end of their dominance and not presence. This was a blind sedition which was started by all tyrants on earth. All the tyrants gathered together in this fitnah which was ended by Allah through the hands of Mujahideen. This was a big incident in which the entire world of infidelity and hypocrisy got disgraced.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same way a bigger Fitnah than ISIS got established in 2017, which was the President of America, Trump. He is the most accursed person in the history of humanity ad has reached rulership and his intentions are also enmity of Islam. And amongst his all accursed steps, the most accursed step was related to his decision about Qod&rsquo;s, whereby he declared Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and wanted to move his embassy over there. Similarly there has been unpleasant incidents have taken place in many regions. There are certain dimensions in which Allah has given respect to Muslim and then there are certain cases where difficulties have also come up.

It happens when the flood comes the population is staying far away but there is a leader who takes them near the shore for some of his personal interests and drown them completely. Anyhow all the dangers that were there in the world are turning towards Pakistan and Pakistan is being prepared for that. The political instability has gone to its peak, the breaking, making is happening with severity; foreign interference is happening mercilessly like Ale Saud who are themselves in big trouble are every other day calling our rulers to give them instructions. Even now as well some of our rulers have gone there. Ale Saud are already engulfed in the Fitnah of Trump and are the pawns for the final Fitnah of Israel.

In 2017 various incidents took place in India specific to the Muslims. The current government of India which started on the basis of enmity of Muslims and Islam continued it further. The identity of current Prime Ministers itself is known as the killer of Muslims. When he was the Chief Minister of the Gujrat state, he did a mass genocide there on Muslims. The Muslims were burnt alive and it was all under his blessings. The Babri Masjid which was an icon of Muslims in India was destroyed and they now want to make a temple over there under the rule of this government.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One important thing that happened in India was that the violence and aggression of Indian government increased. In the past India was not counted as a violent, aggressive country but now it is whereby violence has become severe in the country. One target of this aggressive violence has been the Muslims. The hatred towards the Muslims has been enhanced and is being done with state support. The have sacrilege the sanctities of Muslims and have killed Muslims that too for strange reasons. <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_10.png" alt="" width="320" height="165" />If a Muslim has eaten beef they have killed them and several Muslims have been killed for the sake of cows. The Muslims are pressurized to either the leave the country or become Hindu. A movement has been started with the title of <em>Ghar Wapsi </em>(Return Home). They tell Muslims that you were Hindus before, and it was those Muslim invaders who came to India in the past who made you Muslims hence you should return back to your original religion of Hinduism. They make this drama also sometimes to show some Muslim converting to Hinduism.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The severe pressure has been in Kashmir where severity and aggressive torture increased. Though there were some foreign elements involved as well which I will mention later. The latest weapons have been used on the Kashmiri Muslims, whereby Pellet guns which is used for hunting on animals has been used aggressively on Muslims and many lost their eyes in that. Then they started the disgraceful act of hair chopping of Muslim women. A movement also started against this violence by Kashmiri&rsquo;s and it is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a severe pressure on the Indian Muslims and under this pressure certain Muslim groups have done strange things. Like in some cases they have dramatized that some Muslims are leaving their religion and becoming Hindus but in certain cases there are Muslims who despite of remaining Muslims do strange things. Some of them are very famous scholars who have been visiting Pakistan also before. They have not converted to Hinduism but they attend the Hindu temples to participate in their acts of worship. They go to the Ganges River and take ritual bath over there. The Hindus go to Ganga River to take ritual bath for purification. The River Ganga is the most polluted river of India where the wastages of big population of Indian is passed into. These Muslim scholars go to Ganga, dive inside to take ritual bath in that water just to demonstrate their unity with Hindus. Some scholars have participated in their temple programs and worshipped the idols; by bowing in front of them and have recited the same hymns which the Hindus were reciting. They did all this to give this impression that we are with Hindu&rsquo;s and are same as them. One stranger thing which the Muslims of India are doing under this pressure is that they have made eulogies (Nauha&rsquo;s) of patriotism and do Matam (chest beating) on these eulogies. They do not recite the eulogies of Imam Hussain (a.s) in Azadari but instead recite the eulogy of patriotism and beat their chest. This kind of love of nation you would not have seen anywhere else where people do Matam (chest beating) in patriotism. They have bands of eulogies who recite these eulogies of patriotism and others beat their chest. Even the Hindu&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be as patriotic as they are. They have become more catholic than the pope. All these things are being done due to pressure and to seek refuge from the Hindu extremism. The Muslims are witnessing this extremism there. There are one billion Hindus and there are two hundred millions but for the sake of security they do all this. They recite Naat&rsquo;s in the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and in the first sentence they recite the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and then everything is in love of India. They have this pressure on them and in order to protect themselves from tyranny they are adopting these methods.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017 what India has done for their interests is that they created a dangerous atmosphere at global level and created big difficulties for Pakistan. America which did not like India before and gave preference to Pakistan because India was friend to Russia. But now America has ideal relation with India and one reason for that is also china. And more than America the nearness developed with Israel is of much bigger scale. The Indian Prime Minister is the first Prime Minister who visited Israel. It was always that the Indian government has supported Palestine but the current government has openly supported Israel. Now the Israeli president is visiting India and Israel&rsquo;s experience has been taken by India to crush the uprising in Kashmir. This is because Israel claims that they are more experienced in crushing Muslims movements. This is not true; they are experts in crushing Arab movements and not crushing Muslim movements. They have seen the Muslim movement of Hezbollah in front of them and they could not do anything and themselves got into danger and trying various things to crush Hezbollah. But Israel claims they have the technology to crush Muslims and India is using that.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2017 has been the year of disputes between India and Pakistan which has always been there as such but in the last year it went to its peak and even at times it came near to the jaws of battle. The forces were ready and rehearsing for the battle. India also went into the state of war with China and both the forces reached the borders and they did stone pelting on borders. The two atomic powers have created this record for stone pelting wars in this century. The plans which China has made to become a superpower is disliked by India and hence India has strong, severe plans and conspiracies against China. They are both atomic powers and the cumulative population of both countries is near to half of world&rsquo;s population. They both reached near too war though it did not happen but the situation remains tense.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1515501737cp.png', 'wSU6PBVXub8', '1515168529India_in_2017.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-09 04:42:17', 'Y'),

They started from 2014 and in 2017 it went further. Pakistan and China have historical friendship and they never had any conflicts. At times the cooperation has been good and sometimes normal. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/china2017.png" alt="" width="313" height="180" />But recently china has taken a lot of serious interests in Pakistan and to fulfill the Chinese plans of modern world silk Route which is One Road, One belt and for that Pakistan is the route and hence has become strategic. China will gain a lot from Pakistan as the journey which China used to do for their goods in months would be traversed in hours. The distance of thousands of kms have reduced significantly. China will enter from the northern Pakistan province of Gilgit and then exit from south in Balochistan. China has made big plans to make new cities in Pakistan and to the extent that China has totally paralyzed the industrialization and production in Pakistan. This has happened to the extent that Pakistan has started to depend a lot on China and as the CPEC project completes Pakistan will become totally dependent on China.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An important step that China has taken in 2017 which as I said before in an earlier speech that 3<sup>rd</sup> step of their global visionary plan has been taken up by their current president. One president got them freedom, second President made them an economy power and this third President is now claiming that china will become the only superpower in the world. First they were economic power but now it will be a superpower in all aspects. They will do the production for entire world and distribute across the world. They are making routes all across, they are making roads, trains in Europe and around. They are acquiring sea ports at various countries specifically small countries on lease the way they have taken the Gwadar port. China is trying to establish their economic centers over there. There is a severe competition at present between China and America. In this competition two contradictory things are happening. America is losing their grip, control day by day over the world and China is gaining it more and more. This is happening on day to day basis and it can reach to a practical war. This is because the actual purpose of making Trump as the President was to control China. All the filthy things which Trump is doing was meant for China only and instead of directly attacking China he has created all this indirect atmosphere. It is possible that in the upcoming years there would be an encounter between America and China. And Since Pakistan is the friend of China it will also become a part of the war on both sides. This means whatever takes place against china it will happen against Pakistan as well and it has already started. The current policy which Trump has made for Pakistan the main reason is their relation with china.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'N', 'N', '15166190761515221141china_in_2017.jpg', 'Jo_ksgw54Gk', '1515213739China_in_2017.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-22 03:04:37', 'Y'),

The most important change has been that the terrorism conspiracy which was in Middle East has been failed by Iran, Hezbollah, Syria and Russia. The Middle East for entire world carries significance and it can get the entire world into a war. And till now the dangers are still there. In this region the greater Middle East plan which was there from America, Israel and European. First it was British who were leading and America deputing them but now America is leading it and Britain is their deputy. Now after more than half century of World War II they want to carry out a new restructuring of Middle East. They want to change political borders, they want to change systems, conspiracies.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They want to remove old faces, new ones should come forward. For this they got changes in some regions and they were proceeding with that but in between a big difficulty, obstacle by the name of Shiite came in, specifically Wilayat. They did not consider this as an obstacle in their conspiracy and this is what happens when arrogant ones make the plan. When they make such plans they ignore certain thing out of arrogance by considering certain things as very small. It was just like in the advent of the Islamic Revolution; America and Iran Shah were sensitive on everything like Communists, Nationalist that they might topple the shah&rsquo;s government but they were not considering the scholars into any account. They would say that what these scholars could do; the most they do is to leave their homes and go to mosques. But what happened is that the Shah&rsquo;s government did not topple by communists or nationalists but it was the religious group that did it. The same has happened here also whereby they were not considering Shias as any power. They made a New Middle East plan and when they came they did not account for the power of Shiite and they got inflicted with a blow from there. Hence the most powerful stratagem which they had made for Middle East got failed in 2017. From this perspective 2017 has become historic year whereby America, European Union and all their allies have faced a complete defeat in 2017. This prestige went to the standard bearers of Islam that is Shiite.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They had made various terrorist groups in the Middle East like Al Nusra, Syrian Liberation front and many others whom they imposed inside Syria, Lebanon, other regions. The Arab states like Qatar, Saudi, Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait gave full support to these groups and Turkey provided logistics support and provided these terrorist the route to enter from Europe to Middle East. America gave all kind of ammunition, support to them so that they can make a Takfirist state in both Iraq and Syria. And this plan of their got failed in 2017 and both Iraq and Syria got liberation from the dominance of ISIS. Though they are present but without dominance and occupation; which they had before by capturing a big region in both of these countries. This is the beginning of their destruction in 2017 and hence 2017 has been a very important year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, one more important thing that happened was the direction which Ale Saud took in 2017 was also a new face of Ale Saud which they all did on American instructions. King Salman became the king and his son became the crown prince and he started encounters inside as well outside. He arrested people inside the country, he caught princes and put them inside prisons. He killed some, he hanged some and made some to repent. He is making a modern, liberal Saudi; this is the beginning and Saudi will become the basis of more disturbance in the Muslims world which America wants them to do.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Palestine, Trump announced that Jerusalem should be made the capital and he declared to move their Embassy to Jerusalem. There was reaction from the Muslim world but the best reaction was from Palestine itself, whereby they declared the third Intifada and the way ISIS was eradicated, god willing this evil of Israel will also get eliminated completely.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Yemen war also a very important turn came despite of the fact the Saudi forces have tried to ruined Yemen completely but the Yemeni&rsquo;s have demonstrated tremendous reactions. First the Saudi warplanes were targeting Yemen but now the Yemen missiles are targeting Saudi, Emirate&rsquo;s they have made successful attacks on Riyadh several times with their scud and cruise missiles. The entire Saudi, Emirates is in their range. The missile they launched last month on Abu Dhabi was a warning signal and not an actual attack that we can do this if you don&rsquo;t refrain. On more incident that happened in Yemen was their ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh who was ruling since decades there. His government was ended and Abdo was made as the leader by Saudi. Saleh initially was confronting Saudi and supporting Houthis but in December last year he changed his loyalty and got killed by his own Yemen warriors. This way this sedition ended which was taking a dangerous course.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, the Arabs have shown a big disgrace. We can give various titles to the year 2017 and among these one title that can be given is the Year of disgrace of Arabs. <img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/yearofdisgrace-2.png" alt="" width="284" height="190" />They have been openly supporting Israel. They have invited trump to lead them in a conference of fifty nations and Trump gave a speech. They have been divided also. Qatar, Saudi, Turkey who were the three pillars of terrorism got divided. They developed discord amongst them. Turkey separated from them and joined the Russian block and supporting Iran. Qatar who also believes in Arab dominance and are themselves ambitious thinks they are more superior and wanted to lead the Arab world. Qatar has invested a lot in Middle East. They took some highly progressive steps like 2022 world cup they planned for Qatar. In sports and media they took big steps. They have a very effective media like Al Jazeera which has multiple channels for News, Sports, and Entertainment and is of a very high level media like BBC, CNN. Al Jazeera has become a very effective channel and one of the demands of Saudi to resolve the problem with Qatar was to dismantle Al Jazeera. Their airline is the best and leading airline in the world. Saudi wanted to put pressure on Qatar to make it step back by applying sanctions but it became the opposite. But in general if you see that Arabs have demonstrated a big disgrace. They have accepted the leadership of Trump, came forward for friendship with Israel and collectively they have opened a front against Iran. Every disgraceful act they have done for confronting Iran.

This accursed presented enmity with Islam in his election campaign. The moment he came into power, became President, he blocked entry of Seven Muslim nations to enter America. He adopted severity against Iran. He kept on taking such steps and eventually turned towards Pakistan and addressed Pakistan in a disgraceful manner.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump has put entire world in danger apart from Middle East, Pakistan which are as such disturbed on daily basis. As an example one bomb blast that took place at 1.5 kms from our seminary near Arafa tower in Lahore but people were living normal life. Because now the people are used to this but outsiders are very concerned when they hear such news and they stop their travel to Pakistan if they get news. But here people do not realize.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The entire world is disturbed, habituated but the European world is at rest. They are making entire world disturbed by spreading sedition but their places remained safe. But in 2017 Europe suffered with many incidents of terrorism done by the same terrorists whom they themselves made. In Belgium, Spain, Britain and France big terrorist attacks took place and was done by the same terrorists whom they had made. France has sent 400 terrorist fighters to ISIS and then every country had their part for which they had to suffer last year.&nbsp; But despite of this Europeans are not afraid of terrorist that much but more afraid of Trump because it is unpredictable what this foolish person can do, might be he triggers a war and European Union will get involved in it. Their views which they present to each other are very interesting as to what they say about trump and what trump talks about them. They view a bigger destruction in Trump more than a world war.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other big thing that happened in Europe was the separation of Britain from Europe. The European Union had become a big power and all the European countries had become like one country. In many things they had made one system; like one currency, immigration system and even they wanted to have one common military. But Britain came out of it which gave a big blow to European Union. The actual thing that is going to happen after a long time is the spark that was under the dust has now again came out and that is the communism of Europeans. This communism which has inflicted big damages on the world has again started. In German new Nazism is coming up, in Italy some community, in Scottish the same feeling of their community, Spain they are dividing, British is raising their voice of communism and likewise all the communities of Europe have started to talk for themselves.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '15166193851515221450accurshed_trump.jpg', 'AQHw8Ta9CaM', '1515215041Accursed_Presidency_of_Trump_in_2017.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-22 03:09:45', 'Y'),

Many incidents took place in Lebanon but with all the incidents the power of Hezbollah further enhanced. The more Saudi, Israel tried to finish Hezbollah and exerted a lot of efforts to extinguish this fire but one that is protected by Allah no one can touch them. Hezbollah has become more powerful now in Lebanon and the way Israel is afraid of Hezbollah now they were not that much before.&nbsp; In the 33 days of war Hezbollah a decade before they taught a good lesson to Israel but this year after battle of Syria, they have almost crushed Israel; they developed more expertise of war and the power of Hezbollah has enhanced a lot.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One incident that took place was related to Saad Hariri, the Prime Minister of Lebanon. Saudi got him to Riyadh and made him to resign in order to give a blow to Iran. Trump makes the design and Mohammad bin Salman acts on it foolishly but both do not get ashamed. They get defeated every day and then again make a new design. The failures which Mohammad bin Salman got, whatever design he made he got failed every day. The biggest disgrace he got was in Lebanon. The Prime minister was their guy and he was pro Saudi. He came in track suite on TV studio in Saudi and gave the resignation that I am resigning due to disturbance by Iran inside Lebanon. Mohammad bin Salman was thinking due to this resignation the supporters of Saad Hariri will come out on street in protests; as a result of this a front will open against Hezbollah for battle and then Iran will come for support of Hezbollah and with the help of America we will take revenge of Syria from Iran in Lebanon. But all this failed; the French President came and took him out to France and then when Saad Hariri returned he said that I don&rsquo;t want to resign and said that what happened in Saudi will remain a secret.This was a big disgrace for Saudi.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Palestine the third Intifada started and due to Trump&rsquo;s announcement this front once again opened.

That message was that Pakistan is a liar, they have cheated us, <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trump-1.png" alt="" width="320" height="182" />we have given 33 billion dollars to Pakistan to end terrorism but they have not done anything. This was the message on the first day of New Year which he has given. Since the first day of the year is a day of celebration for the Westerners. They give gifts, send greetings to each other but Trump did not start the year with greetings but instead threatened Pakistan that they are cheaters and have taken 33 billion dollars in 15 yrs and have not done anything. Yesterday he has given an ultimatum to Pakistan for 48 hours to start some operation else Trump will start his actions on them. This is an abnormal thing for Pakistan that those whom Pakistan has trusted behave in this manner.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accursed step for Pakistan was when the delegation from Pakistan went to America around 1954 to start their friendship with them. From that day the destruction of Pakistan started which has reached here. The current Foreign Minister of Pakistan has issued this statement that on the instructions of America we have filled the prisons of America that is Guantanamo with Pakistanis. It is the worst prison in history which has been filled with Pakistanis and our Foreign Minister has expressed our services. We have handed over our airports, lands, depots and you started a war in Afghanistan and we handed over our country at your disposal. You made terrorists and put them on our back and now you are telling that we are not able to control them. This is the formal statement of Pakistani Foreign Minister as to what foolishness the Pakistan rulers have done on the instructions of America. Trump has said we have given you 33 billion dollars in last 15 years but what has been given 45 yrs before has been also much more. It is evident that people like Zia ul Haqq and Musharraf come into power; then they associate their illegitimate power with America and start to take funds from them. They rent out the entire nation to America with various excuses. Now Trump is asking accounts from them that we have paid you 33 billion dollars to end terrorism then why you are not doing it. The Pakistani community should also ask their rulers why you took this money and to take this money is a crime as you have sold the nation to them. They are all criminals who sold their country to a Satan for 33 billion dollars. This statement of Trump has increased threats for Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We should pay attention to this fact that there was a slogan which Shia community taught to everyone but they themselves have forgotten it. That slogan was &ldquo;One who befriends America, is a Traitor of Islam&rdquo;. This is the outcome of that treachery. The natural result of friendship with a Satan like America is this only. The actual traitor is not Trump in fact they are those who have handed over the country to America but our community remains silent. They express a little in a fearful manner against Trump but those traitors of our country who have given all this to America they don&rsquo;t do anything about them. This is not the first time America has insulted Pakistan and this has a big history on how much insult they have done and every time they have said anything about Pakistan it has been an insult only but they have not heard a reply single time from Pakistan; neither from community nor from the government or politicians.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No one replied because they are all lovers of America. All your rulers have dual nationality of America; their children stay there, they have bank account there, they have investments in America. They reach America on the second day of retirement. If some media, researcher can do this work to find out how many Pakistan rulers, Generals and patriots are in American after their retirement. Army Generals, court Judge, bureaucrats, Minister, President all after retirement go to America. Every children of this community are desperate to go to America. Those who are raising slogan of Anti America they are the first ones ready to go to America. We have accepted disgrace and Trump takes advantage of this disgracefulness of ours. He knows that he is addressing a nation who will not give any reply to any insults. And we have not given any reply. He has issued a statement on 1<sup>st</sup> January and today is 5<sup>th</sup> January. What have the Pakistanis done in these 5 days? The government has called a Cabinet meeting and decided that we will not rush. This is a disgrace. The same day they should have got the American Ambassador out from here and the Pakistani Ambassador should have been called back. The American Embassy should have been closed and all contracts, agreements should have terminated. America said that we will not give any aid from now on to Pakistan. It is natural that those who are fed on aid cannot do anything. You can see where all these aids go. One aid comes for government rulers, one comes for special defense forces and one comes for people as US AID. You can see the banners of US Aid on Shia homes as well. He is also eating the bread from US Aid, he is taking sugar, sheep from US Aid. When the belly of every Pakistani has US Aid; inside Minister, forces and scholars then Trump has the rights to insult. But a zealot, self-respected community does not feed themselves with such aids. We should throw this inside gutter and do not allow these aids to reach your localities so that they don&rsquo;t do this disgrace to us.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest tragedy of Pakistan is that there is no comprehensive policy for the country. We work on daily wages system and just think about today; we eat and then sleep and then get up next day to decide what we have to do. China, America makes policies for us. The financial institutions makes polices for us whether we should give birth to children or not. A community which is not having this much sense and for whom IMF tells whether you should grow your population or not then what rights do they have. When there is a policy, a goal, a system and then under that if we do the defense of our system. There are millions of unemployed youths who have no jobs, education systems, no plans or policies for using them somewhere and not even for national interests. They are left on their own state and private institutions are teaching them. The government has taken 33 billion dollars, so if you have taken this then at least you should have used this accursed money for some constructive work in the country. Two funding&rsquo;s have become the basis of destruction for Pakistan; one is the wealth of Ale Saud and second is the funding of Trump.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The selfhood and self-respect of Pakistan nation and community can only get us out of this disgrace and not the politicians. The politicians are desperately hungry for the bones of power. They are hungry to this extent that they don&rsquo;t realize what they are doing, what they should do for the sake of power. Look at the religious people what they are doing for the sake of power. They have become blind for power and they cannot give salvation to the community as they lack selfhood. This selfhood should get developed in the youths of this nation. These youths should develop this self-respect that we should not be disgraced. The rulers, politician eat the Mooney and we suffer disgrace. Pakistan is trying to reply on this; they will go to Saudi and ask them to plead to America and make them talk; then they will go to Britain to seek help or they will accept all the demands to catch so and so network and do what they do. But this is not the solution.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trump-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="215" />The Supreme Leader used to tell that if you listen to one demand of America they will force you to accept hundred more hence do not accept even the first demand from them. But the Iranian government also did not listen to the leader and accepted their demand on atomic negotiation and now they are demanding from them too stop missiles, stop supporting Hezbollah and now they even say that religious clerics should come out from government and end the system of Wilayat e Faqeeh. Do not arrest anyone on the instructions of America. If you want to break any organization do it on your own and not on the ordinances of America. You restrict some terrorist entity because they are threat to Pakistan and not for the sake of America.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present Iran and Pakistan both are under the similar crisis. America wants to punish Pakistan for the sake of friendship with China. What should Pakistan do now? They should give reply to this insult and reply should be the same which Imam Khomeini (r.a) and his followers gave to America. Shaheed Beheshti gave a historic statement when America was perplexed and the American President at that time also was issuing such crazy statements. He said; O America become more and more annoyed with us to the extent that you die out of this annoyance. This was the same reply which the Supreme Leader again gave to America few weeks back when Trump tried to insult.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present for both Pakistan and Iran the best reply which they can give to America both against their insults and conspiracies is in Afghanistan. At present America is under captivity in Afghanistan. The crisis which are there in Afghanistan then under that crisis they should give them a blow. If America can be beaten up somewhere brutally then that is Afghanistan. This is the reason Afghanistan is very important. America has already got all the Takfirist waste from Iraq, Syria to Afghanistan using Arab wealth. This 48 hrs. ultimatum which they have given to Pakistan and he has left it dotted as to what they can do. The will do Drone attacks, they will send commandos to Lahore and will take anyone out they want and Pakistanis will remain observing. Both Iran and Pakistan are undergoing similar issues from Trump. Trump is targeting both Pakistan and Iran but remember that his actual target is China. In order to reach China the countries that are on route he wants to first manage them; and they are North Korea, Iran and Pakistan. The interests of Iran and Pakistan are very close specifically as regards to Trump policy they are one; he wants to finish both; he is giving deadlines, warnings to both.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Trump has called for United Nations meeting related to the protests in Iran. At present Pakistan and Iran should have the same strategy as their enemy has the same strategy for them. They should adopt this action plan and Afghanistan is that place where America can be disgraced like Vietnam and even Afghanis can also get relieved from the terrorism. What kind of logic is this that you get all the terrorist from the world in one place? America has done this to go after Iran and Pakistan. The same way they gathered terrorists in Syria and Iran, Russia, Hezbollah disgraced them over there and now it is the turn of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They can take help from China, Russia and give this accursed a lessonful defeat in Afghanistan so that they get destroyed there.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ale Saud did one more thing that they called Pakistan rulers to Saudi on one phone call. They are always ready to come on one call. One day Mohammad bin Salman will also say that they have taken 33 billion from us but not done anything. Trump has said this already and similarly Mohammad bin Salman will also have to say this one day that Pakistan has not done anything for us. For the Pakistan rulers if you are taking Rials from Saudi, then take but don&rsquo;t put Pakistan on the same direction as they want. Mohammad bin Salman wants rented people, labor, forces, and terrorists from Pakistan. He knows that entire Pakistan is on rent. This intellect should be there in Pakistan that they should not go on rent and don&rsquo;t do whatever they want to do.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1515227256c.jpg', '1DNgvXDcvJY', '1515217537TrumpsHappy_New_Year_Greeting_to_Pakistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-06 20:12:05', 'Y'),

The people there on the basis of price inflation of commodities, which is said due to economic sanctions applied by USA; some of them protested with anti-government slogans and also slogans against sanctities. But day before yesterday on Wednesday; the same way like in 2009 the entire Iranian community came out on street for demonstrations to end the Fitnah; the same was done again now to end this Fitnah. I have been discussing about this subject since a long time; that the Iranian people will be bought under pressure and aroused against government. This weakness is there in Iran that the people get influenced with difficulties. They need more welfare and if there is shortfall they object. The sanctions are that tool which America understood late. By applying sanctions, restrictions they foiled the atomic plan of Iran. The Iranian community has proved that they get highly disturbed with sanctions and America also knows that it is with sanctions that they can inflict blow on Iran. If Iranians get affected by sanctions then America knows that this is the tool they should use. With sanctions, international cash flow stops, relations with other nations are cut off; the basic necessities don&rsquo;t reach people and they face difficulties then rise against the government. Then whatever Trump and America wants the people start to do. This is the policy of America to keep people under economic pressure and then arouse them to stand against the government. This weakness is found in Iran that on one hand there are those who are not afraid of bullets, martyrdom, missiles and fighting in Iraq and Syria. Then there is another group of people who are afraid of scarcity of bread and they are the ones who make more noise and give more damage. But with all praises to God, just like before they got ashamed. On Wednesday the entire nation came out in support of Leader and the system; this way this entire Fitnah got eliminated. Ale Saud did a big investment for these riots in Iran. They wanted to move the battle inside Iran and wanted to teach Iran a lesson inside. The Arab media has raised these protests and riots a lot. There would be few people in protests, riots but media showed in big way.

We have to analyze all these.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">First let us look at the territories around Pakistan, then Global and then we come to Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indian government&rsquo;s aggression on Muslims in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the neighborhood of Pakistan is India. In 2017 various incidents took place in India specific to the Muslims. The current government of India which started on the basis of enmity of Muslims and Islam continued it further. The identity of current Prime Ministers itself is known as the killer of Muslims. When he was the Chief Minister of the Gujrat state, he did a mass genocide there on Muslims. The Muslims were burnt alive and it was all under his blessings. The Babri Masjid which was an icon of Muslims in India was destroyed and they now want to make a temple over there under the rule of this government.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One important thing that happened in India was that the violence and aggression of Indian government increased. In the past India was not counted as a violent, aggressive country but now it is whereby violence has become severe in the country. One target of this aggressive violence has been the Muslims. The hatred towards the Muslims has been enhanced and is being done with state support. The have sacrilege the sanctities of Muslims and have killed Muslims that too for strange reasons. If a Muslim has eaten beef they have killed them and several Muslims have been killed for the sake of cows. The Muslims are pressurized to either the leave the country or become Hindu. A movement has been started with the title of <em>Ghar Wapsi </em>(Return Home). They tell Muslims that you were Hindus before, and it was those Muslim invaders who came to India in the past who made you Muslims hence you should return back to your original religion of Hinduism. They make this drama also sometimes to show some Muslim converting to Hinduism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The severe pressure has been in Kashmir where severity and aggressive torture increased. Though there were some foreign elements involved as well which I will mention later. The latest weapons have been used on the Kashmiri Muslims, whereby Pellet guns which is used for hunting on animals has been used aggressively on Muslims and many lost their eyes in that. Then they started the disgraceful act of hair chopping of Muslim women. A movement also started against this violence by Kashmiri&rsquo;s and it is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a severe pressure on the Indian Muslims and under this pressure certain Muslim groups have done strange things. Like in some cases they have dramatized that some <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/3_11.png" alt="" width="320" height="165" />Muslims are leaving their religion and becoming Hindus but in certain cases there are Muslims who despite of remaining Muslims do strange things. Some of them are very famous scholars who have been visiting Pakistan also before. They have not converted to Hinduism but they attend the Hindu temples to participate in their acts of worship. They go to the Ganges River and take ritual bath over there. The Hindus go to Ganga River to take ritual bath for purification. The River Ganga is the most polluted river of India where the wastages of big population of Indian is passed into. These Muslim scholars go to Ganga, dive inside to take ritual bath in that water just to demonstrate their unity with Hindus. Some scholars have participated in their temple programs and worshipped the idols; by bowing in front of them and have recited the same hymns which the Hindus were reciting. They did all this to give this impression that we are with Hindu&rsquo;s and are same as them. One stranger thing which the Muslims of India are doing under this pressure is that they have made eulogies (Nauha&rsquo;s) of patriotism and do Matam (chest beating) on these eulogies. They do not recite the eulogies of Imam Hussain (a.s) in Azadari but instead recite the eulogy of patriotism and beat their chest. This kind of love of nation you would not have seen anywhere else where people do Matam (chest beating) in patriotism. They have bands of eulogies who recite these eulogies of patriotism and others beat their chest. Even the Hindu&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be as patriotic as they are. They have become more catholic than the pope. All these things are being done due to pressure and to seek refuge from the Hindu extremism. The Muslims are witnessing this extremism there. There are one billion Hindus and there are two hundred millions but for the sake of security they do all this. They recite Naat&rsquo;s in the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and in the first sentence they recite the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and then everything is in love of India. They have this pressure on them and in order to protect themselves from tyranny they are adopting these methods.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017 what India has done for their interests is that they created a dangerous atmosphere at global level and created big difficulties for Pakistan. America which did not like India before and gave preference to Pakistan because India was friend to Russia. But now America has ideal relation with India and one reason for that is also china. And more than America the nearness developed with Israel is of much bigger scale. The Indian Prime Minister is the first Prime Minister who visited Israel. It was always that the Indian government has supported Palestine but the current government has openly supported Israel. Now the Israeli president is visiting India and Israel&rsquo;s experience has been taken by India to crush the uprising in Kashmir. This is because Israel claims that they are more experienced in crushing Muslims movements. This is not true; they are experts in crushing Arab movements and not crushing Muslim movements. They have seen the Muslim movement of Hezbollah in front of them and they could not do anything and themselves got into danger and trying various things to crush Hezbollah. But Israel claims they have the technology to crush Muslims and India is using that.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2017 has been the year of disputes between India and Pakistan which has always been there as such but in the last year it went to its peak and even at times it came near to the jaws of battle. The forces were ready and rehearsing for the battle. India also went into the state of war with China and both the forces reached the borders and they did stone pelting on borders. The two atomic powers have created this record for stone pelting wars in this century. The plans which China has made to become a superpower is disliked by India and hence India has strong, severe plans and conspiracies against China. They are both atomic powers and the cumulative population of both countries is near to half of world&rsquo;s population. They both reached near too war though it did not happen but the situation remains tense.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>China in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another neighbor of Pakistan is China which has progressed a lot in 2017. They started from 2014 and in 2017 it went further. Pakistan and China have historical friendship and they never had any conflicts. At times the cooperation has been good and sometimes normal. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/china2017.png" alt="" width="313" height="180" />But recently china has taken a lot of serious interests in Pakistan and to fulfill the Chinese plans of modern world silk Route which is One Road, One belt and for that Pakistan is the route and hence has become strategic. China will gain a lot from Pakistan as the journey which China used to do for their goods in months would be traversed in hours. The distance of thousands of kms have reduced significantly. China will enter from the northern Pakistan province of Gilgit and then exit from south in Balochistan. China has made big plans to make new cities in Pakistan and to the extent that China has totally paralyzed the industrialization and production in Pakistan. This has happened to the extent that Pakistan has started to depend a lot on China and as the CPEC project completes Pakistan will become totally dependent on China.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An important step that China has taken in 2017 which as I said before in an earlier speech that 3<sup>rd</sup> step of their global visionary plan has been taken up by their current president. One president got them freedom, second President made them an economy power and this third President is now claiming that china will become the only superpower in the world. First they were economic power but now it will be a superpower in all aspects. They will do the production for entire world and distribute across the world. They are making routes all across, they are making roads, trains in Europe and around. They are acquiring sea ports at various countries specifically small countries on lease the way they have taken the Gwadar port. China is trying to establish their economic centers over there. There is a severe competition at present between China and America. In this competition two contradictory things are happening. America is losing their grip, control day by day over the world and China is gaining it more and more. This is happening on day to day basis and it can reach to a practical war. This is because the actual purpose of making Trump as the President was to control China. All the filthy things which Trump is doing was meant for China only and instead of directly attacking China he has created all this indirect atmosphere. It is possible that in the upcoming years there would be an encounter between America and China. And Since Pakistan is the friend of China it will also become a part of the war on both sides. This means whatever takes place against china it will happen against Pakistan as well and it has already started. The current policy which Trump has made for Pakistan the main reason is their relation with china.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these topics need more elaboration and here I am only discuss a list.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Year of Disgrace for Arabs in Middle </strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/disgrace-1.png" alt="" width="284" height="190" />The Middle East has been the most important region in 2017 and the ongoing incidents from before have seen dramatic changes in 2017 and there has been both positive and negative progress as well. The most important change has been that the terrorism conspiracy which was in Middle East has been failed by Iran, Hezbollah, Syria and Russia. The Middle East for entire world carries significance and it can get the entire world into a war. And till now the dangers are still there. In this region the greater Middle East plan which was there from America, Israel and European. First it was British who were leading and America deputing them but now America is leading it and Britain is their deputy. Now after more than half century of World War II they want to carry out a new restructuring of Middle East. They want to change political borders, they want to change systems, conspiracies.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They want to remove old faces, new ones should come forward. For this they got changes in some regions and they were proceeding with that but in between a big difficulty, obstacle by the name of Shiite came in, specifically Wilayat. They did not consider this as an obstacle in their conspiracy and this is what happens when arrogant ones make the plan. When they make such plans they ignore certain thing out of arrogance by considering certain things as very small. It was just like in the advent of the Islamic Revolution; America and Iran Shah were sensitive on everything like Communists, Nationalist that they might topple the shah&rsquo;s government but they were not considering the scholars into any account. They would say that what these scholars could do; the most they do is to leave their homes and go to mosques. But what happened is that the Shah&rsquo;s government did not topple by communists or nationalists but it was the religious group that did it. The same has happened here also whereby they were not considering Shias as any power. They made a New Middle East plan and when they came they did not account for the power of Shiite and they got inflicted with a blow from there. Hence the most powerful stratagem which they had made for Middle East got failed in 2017. From this perspective 2017 has become historic year whereby America, European Union and all their allies have faced a complete defeat in 2017. This prestige went to the standard bearers of Islam that is Shiite.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They had made various terrorist groups in the Middle East like Al Nusra, Syrian Liberation front and many others whom they imposed inside Syria, Lebanon, other regions. The Arab states like Qatar, Saudi, Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait gave full support to these groups and Turkey provided logistics support and provided these terrorist the route to enter from Europe to Middle East. America gave all kind of ammunition, support to them so that they can make a Takfirist state in both Iraq and Syria. And this plan of their got failed in 2017 and both Iraq and Syria got liberation from the dominance of ISIS. Though they are present but without dominance and occupation; which they had before by capturing a big region in both of these countries. This is the beginning of their destruction in 2017 and hence 2017 has been a very important year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, one more important thing that happened was the direction which Ale Saud took in 2017 was also a new face of Ale Saud which they all did on American instructions. King Salman became the king and his son became the crown prince and he started encounters inside as well outside. He arrested people inside the country, he caught princes and put them inside prisons. He killed some, he hanged some and made some to repent. He is making a modern, liberal Saudi; this is the beginning and Saudi will become the basis of more disturbance in the Muslims world which America wants them to do.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Palestine, Trump announced that Jerusalem should be made the capital and he declared to move their Embassy to Jerusalem. There was reaction from the Muslim world but the best reaction was from Palestine itself, whereby they declared the third Intifada and the way ISIS was eradicated, god willing this evil of Israel will also get eliminated completely.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Yemen war also a very important turn came despite of the fact the Saudi forces have tried to ruined Yemen completely but the Yemeni&rsquo;s have demonstrated tremendous reactions. First the Saudi warplanes were targeting Yemen but now the Yemen missiles are targeting Saudi, Emirate&rsquo;s they have made successful attacks on Riyadh several times with their scud and cruise missiles. The entire Saudi, Emirates is in their range. The missile they launched last month on Abu Dhabi was a warning signal and not an actual attack that we can do this if you don&rsquo;t refrain. On more incident that happened in Yemen was their ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh who was ruling since decades there. His government was ended and Abdo was made as the leader by Saudi. Saleh initially was confronting Saudi and supporting Houthis but in December last year he changed his loyalty and got killed by his own Yemen warriors. This way this sedition ended which was taking a dangerous course.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, the Arabs have shown a big disgrace. We can give various titles to the year 2017 and among these one title that can be given is the Year of disgrace of Arabs. They have been openly supporting Israel. They have invited trump to lead them in a conference of fifty nations and Trump gave a speech. They have been divided also. Qatar, Saudi, Turkey who were the three pillars of terrorism got divided. They developed discord amongst them. Turkey separated from them and joined the Russian block and supporting Iran. Qatar<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/yearofdisgrace-2.png" alt="" width="295" height="197" /> who also believes in Arab dominance and are themselves ambitious thinks they are more superior and wanted to lead the Arab world. Qatar has invested a lot in Middle East. They took some highly progressive steps like 2022 world cup they planned for Qatar. In sports and media they took big steps. They have a very effective media like Al Jazeera which has multiple channels for News, Sports, and Entertainment and is of a very high level media like BBC, CNN. Al Jazeera has become a very effective channel and one of the demands of Saudi to resolve the problem with Qatar was to dismantle Al Jazeera. Their airline is the best and leading airline in the world. Saudi wanted to put pressure on Qatar to make it step back by applying sanctions but it became the opposite. But in general if you see that Arabs have demonstrated a big disgrace. They have accepted the leadership of Trump, came forward for friendship with Israel and collectively they have opened a front against Iran. Every disgraceful act they have done for confronting Iran. They made a 34 countries alliance force but that has not been successful. They have a commander from Pakistan but other countries just come for conference, stay in good hotels, eat good food and then go back.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accursed Presidency of Trump in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017 the most accursed thing that has happened is that Trump has become the President of America,<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trumpin%202017.png" alt="" width="329" height="187" /> and he is the most accursed and foolish President. This accursed presented enmity with Islam in his election campaign. The moment he came into power, became President, he blocked entry of Seven Muslim nations to enter America. He adopted severity against Iran. He kept on taking such steps and eventually turned towards Pakistan and addressed Pakistan in a disgraceful manner.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump has put entire world in danger apart from Middle East, Pakistan which are as such disturbed on daily basis. As an example one bomb blast that took place at 1.5 kms from our seminary near Arafa tower in Lahore but people were living normal life. Because now the people are used to this but outsiders are very concerned when they hear such news and they stop their travel to Pakistan if they get news. But here people do not realize.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The entire world is disturbed, habituated but the European world is at rest. They are making entire world disturbed by spreading sedition but their places remained safe. But in 2017 Europe suffered with many incidents of terrorism done by the same terrorists whom they themselves made. In Belgium, Spain, Britain and France big terrorist attacks took place and was done by the same terrorists whom they had made. France has sent 400 terrorist fighters to ISIS and then every country had their part for which they had to suffer last year.&nbsp; But despite of this Europeans are not afraid of terrorist that much but more afraid of Trump because it is unpredictable what this foolish person can do, might be he triggers a war and European Union will get involved in it. Their views which they present to each other are very interesting as to what they say about trump and what trump talks about them. They view a bigger destruction in Trump more than a world war.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other big thing that happened in Europe was the separation of Britain from Europe. The European Union had become a big power and all the European countries had become like one country. In many things they had made one system; like one currency, immigration system and even they wanted to have one common military. But Britain came out of it which gave a big blow to European Union. The actual thing that is going to happen after a long time is the spark that was under the dust has now again came out and that is the communism of Europeans. This communism which has inflicted big damages on the world has again started. In German new Nazism is coming up, in Italy some community, in Scottish the same feeling of their community, Spain they are dividing, British is raising their voice of communism and likewise all the communities of Europe have started to talk for themselves.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>No mercy Rohingya Muslims in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/rohingyamuslim.png" alt="" width="245" height="140" />In 2017, one bitter incident that took place was the Rohingya Muslims suffering which became more severe. Thousands of Muslims were killed, homes were burnt; they thrown into sea, burnt alive, children&rsquo;s killed and with highest difficulty around 600,000 Rohingya left Myanmar and came to Bangladesh and there was no help, support to them and in fact criticism. During the same period Pope visited Myanmar and he also did not say a single sentence to them instead he met that women in power and certified their acts. The crisis of Rohingya is going on, there were some dialogues only at media level amongst some Muslim rulers for some time and then again it all became silent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sufferings of African Muslims in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/africanmuslims.png" alt="" width="261" height="149" />In 2017 two bitter incidents that took place were in Somalia where terrorist attacks took place and at a vast scale people died in a brutal manner and mostly Muslims. Similarly in Nigeria terrorism has increased and the Shias were besieged from before after the attack on Sheikh Zakzaky; whereby he was arrested, tortured and that is still going on. Few days back as well the Shias were attacked and at intervals this goes on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly we can say that most brutal, bloody incident of this decade was a very dreadful attack that took place was in Egypt. The terrorist attacked a mosque in the form of an army on Friday few days back and martyred all praying Muslims. There have been many incidents in Egypt in 2017 and the Egyptian government which is the most useless, unreasonable government for the sake of power do not refrain from any oppression.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hezbollah in Lebanon strengthens in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/lebanon.png" alt="" width="274" height="184" />In Lebanon in 2017, various incidents took place specifically due to being neighbor of Syria. Many incidents took place in Lebanon but with all the incidents the power of Hezbollah further enhanced. The more Saudi, Israel tried to finish Hezbollah and exerted a lot of efforts to extinguish this fire but one that is protected by Allah no one can touch them. Hezbollah has become more powerful now in Lebanon and the way Israel is afraid of Hezbollah now they were not that much before.&nbsp; In the 33 days of war Hezbollah a decade before they taught a good lesson to Israel but this year after battle of Syria, they have almost crushed Israel; they developed more expertise of war and the power of Hezbollah has enhanced a lot.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One incident that took place was related to Saad Hariri, the Prime Minister of Lebanon. Saudi got him to Riyadh and made him to resign in order to give a blow to Iran. Trump makes the design and Mohammad bin Salman acts on it foolishly but both do not get ashamed. They get defeated every day and then again make a new design. The failures which Mohammad bin Salman got, whatever design he made he got failed every day. The biggest disgrace he got was in Lebanon. The Prime minister was their guy and he was pro Saudi. He came in track suite on TV studio in Saudi and gave the resignation that I am resigning due to disturbance by Iran inside Lebanon. Mohammad bin Salman was thinking due to this resignation the supporters of Saad Hariri will come out on street in protests; as a result of this a front will open against Hezbollah for battle and then Iran will come for support of Hezbollah and with the help of America we will take revenge of Syria from Iran in Lebanon. But all this failed; the French President came and took him out to France and then when Saad Hariri returned he said that I don&rsquo;t want to resign and said that what happened in Saudi will remain a secret. This was a big disgrace for Saudi.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Palestine the third Intifada started and due to Trump&rsquo;s announcement this front once again opened. But the Palestinian organizations which are fighting for liberation of Palestine; like Al Fath, whose leader is Mahmoud Abbas have done a lot of treachery. But since Intifada has started this is something good which is about to happen.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Afghanistan turning into terrorist hub for America in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/afghan%20turn%20into%20terrorist.png" alt="" width="287" height="161" />America has presented a new plan of action for Afghanistan in 2017. As part of this all issues of Afghanistan like security, poverty and even cold weather (taunting) is due to Pakistan. Trump has made Pakistan responsible for all issues inside Afghanistan. There are big issues coming up in Afghanistan and in last few weeks big attacks are being done and even on Shias centers; the last one being Tebyan institute. Yesterday also three blasts took place. In 2017, one more act that has started is that the defeated ISIS terrorists are being moved to Afghanistan. All the terrorist forces which America has made in the world they are moving them to Afghanistan so that they can control both Pakistan and Iran and reach the objectives specifically against Iran which they could not do the same way in Middle East. Hence the issue of Afghanistan is very important.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The two important issues for this discussion were the issues of Pakistan and Iran.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trump&rsquo;s Happy New Year greeting to Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the first day of 2018; Trump the accursed got up from his sleep; first thing he did was sat on his computer and issued the first message for Pakistan. That message was that Pakistan is a liar, they have cheated us, we have given <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trump-1.png" alt="" width="310" height="176" />33 billion dollars to Pakistan to end terrorism but they have not done anything. This was the message on the first day of New Year which he has given. Since the first day of the year is a day of celebration for the Westerners. They give gifts, send greetings to each other but Trump did not start the year with greetings but instead threatened Pakistan that they are cheaters and have taken 33 billion dollars in 15 yrs and have not done anything. Yesterday he has given an ultimatum to Pakistan for 48 hours to start some operation else Trump will start his actions on them. This is an abnormal thing for Pakistan that those whom Pakistan has trusted behave in this manner.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accursed step for Pakistan was when the delegation from Pakistan went to America around 1954 to start their friendship with them. From that day the destruction of Pakistan started which has reached here. The current Foreign Minister of Pakistan has issued this statement that on the instructions of America we have filled the prisons of America that is Guantanamo with Pakistanis. It is the worst prison in history which has been filled with Pakistanis and our Foreign Minister has expressed our services. We have handed over our airports, lands, depots and you started a war in Afghanistan and we handed over our country at your disposal. You made terrorists and put them on our back and now you are telling that we are not able to control them. This is the formal statement of Pakistani Foreign Minister as to what foolishness the Pakistan rulers have done on the instructions of America. Trump has said we have given you 33 billion dollars in last 15 years but what has been given 45 yrs before has been also much more. It is evident that people like Zia ul Haqq and Musharraf come into power; then they associate their illegitimate power with America and start to take funds from them. They rent out the entire nation to America with various excuses. Now Trump is asking accounts from them that we have paid you 33 billion dollars to end terrorism then why you are not doing it. The Pakistani community should also ask their rulers why you took this money and to take this money is a crime as you have sold the nation to them. They are all criminals who sold their country to a Satan for 33 billion dollars. This statement of Trump has increased threats for Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We should pay attention to this fact that there was a slogan which Shia community taught to everyone but they themselves have forgotten it. That slogan was &ldquo;One who befriends America, is a Traitor of Islam&rdquo;. This is the outcome of that treachery. The natural result of friendship with a Satan like America is this only. The actual traitor is not Trump in fact they are those who have handed over the country to America but our community remains silent. They express a little in a fearful manner against Trump but those traitors of our country who have given all this to America they don&rsquo;t do anything about them. This is not the first time America has insulted Pakistan and this has a big history on how much insult they have done and every time they have said anything about Pakistan it has been an insult only but they have not heard a reply single time from Pakistan; neither from community nor from the government or politicians.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No one replied because they are all lovers of America. All your rulers have dual nationality of America; their children stay there, they have bank account there, they have investments in America. They reach America on the second day of retirement. If some media, researcher can do this work to find out how many Pakistan rulers, Generals and patriots are in American after their retirement. Army Generals, court Judge, bureaucrats, Minister, President all after retirement go to America. Every children of this community are desperate to go to America. Those who are raising slogan of Anti America they are the first ones ready to go to America. We have accepted disgrace and Trump takes advantage of this disgracefulness of ours. He knows that he is addressing a nation who will not give any reply to any insults. And we have not given any reply. He has issued a statement on 1<sup>st</sup> January and today is 5<sup>th</sup> January. What have the Pakistanis done in these 5 days? The government has called a Cabinet meeting and decided that we will not rush. This is a disgrace. The same day they should have got the American Ambassador out from here and the Pakistani Ambassador should have been called back. The American Embassy should have been closed and all contracts, agreements should have terminated. America said that we will not give any aid from now on to Pakistan. It is natural that those who are fed on aid cannot do anything. You can see where all these aids go. One aid comes for government rulers, one comes for special defense forces and one comes for people as US AID. You can see the banners of US Aid on Shia homes as well. He is also eating the bread from US Aid, he is taking sugar, sheep from US Aid. When the belly of every Pakistani has US Aid; inside Minister, forces and scholars then Trump has the rights to insult. But a zealot, self-respected community does not feed themselves with such aids. We should throw this inside gutter and do not allow these aids to reach your localities so that they don&rsquo;t do this disgrace to us.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest tragedy of Pakistan is that there is no comprehensive policy for the country. We work on daily wages system and just think about today; we eat and then sleep and then get up next day to decide what we have to do. China, America makes policies for us. The financial institutions makes polices for us whether we should give birth to children or not. A community which is not having this much sense and for whom IMF tells whether you should grow your population or not then what rights do they have. When there is a policy, a goal, a system and then under that if we do the defense of our system. There are millions of unemployed youths who have no jobs, education systems, no plans or policies for using them somewhere and not even for national interests. They are left on their own state and private institutions are teaching them. The government has taken 33 billion dollars, so if you have taken this then at least you should have used this accursed money for some constructive work in the country. Two funding&rsquo;s have become the basis of destruction for Pakistan; one is the wealth of Ale Saud and second is the funding of Trump.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The selfhood and self-respect of Pakistan nation and community can only get us out of this disgrace and not the politicians. The politicians are desperately hungry for the bones of power. They are hungry to this extent that they don&rsquo;t realize what they are doing, what they should do for the sake of power. Look at the religious people what they are doing for the sake of power. They have become blind for power and they cannot give salvation to the community as they lack selfhood. This selfhood should get developed in the youths of this nation. These youths should develop this self-respect that we should not be disgraced. The rulers, politician eat the Mooney and we suffer disgrace. Pakistan is trying to reply on this; they will go to Saudi and ask them to plead to America and make them talk; then they will go to Britain to seek help or they will accept all the demands to catch so and so network and do what they do. But this is not the solution.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trump-2.png" alt="" width="290" height="208" />The Supreme Leader used to tell that if you listen to one demand of America they will force you to accept hundred more hence do not accept even the first demand from them. But the Iranian government also did not listen to the leader and accepted their demand on atomic negotiation and now they are demanding from them too stop missiles, stop supporting Hezbollah and now they even say that religious clerics should come out from government and end the system of Wilayat e Faqeeh. Do not arrest anyone on the instructions of America. If you want to break any organization do it on your own and not on the ordinances of America. You restrict some terrorist entity because they are threat to Pakistan and not for the sake of America.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present Iran and Pakistan both are under the similar crisis. America wants to punish Pakistan for the sake of friendship with China. What should Pakistan do now? They should give reply to this insult and reply should be the same which Imam Khomeini (r.a) and his followers gave to America. Shaheed Beheshti gave a historic statement when America was perplexed and the American President at that time also was issuing such crazy statements. He said; O America become more and more annoyed with us to the extent that you die out of this annoyance. This was the same reply which the Supreme Leader again gave to America few weeks back when Trump tried to insult.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At present for both Pakistan and Iran the best reply which they can give to America both against their insults and conspiracies is in Afghanistan. At present America is under captivity in Afghanistan. The crisis which are there in Afghanistan then under that crisis they should give them a blow. If America can be beaten up somewhere brutally then that is Afghanistan. This is the reason Afghanistan is very important. America has already got all the Takfirist waste from Iraq, Syria to Afghanistan using Arab wealth. This 48 hrs. ultimatum which they have given to Pakistan and he has left it dotted as to what they can do. The will do Drone attacks, they will send commandos to Lahore and will take anyone out they want and Pakistanis will remain observing. Both Iran and Pakistan are undergoing similar issues from Trump. Trump is targeting both Pakistan and Iran but remember that his actual target is China. In order to reach China the countries that are on route he wants to first manage them; and they are North Korea, Iran and Pakistan. The interests of Iran and Pakistan are very close specifically as regards to Trump policy they are one; he wants to finish both; he is giving deadlines, warnings to both.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Trump has called for United Nations meeting related to the protests in Iran. At present Pakistan and Iran should have the same strategy as their enemy has the same strategy for them. They should adopt this action plan and Afghanistan is that place where America can be disgraced like Vietnam and even Afghanis can also get relieved from the terrorism. What kind of logic is this that you get all the terrorist from the world in one place? America has done this to go after Iran and Pakistan. The same way they gathered terrorists in Syria and Iran, Russia, Hezbollah disgraced them over there and now it is the turn of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They can take help from China, Russia and give this accursed a lessonful defeat in Afghanistan so that they get destroyed there.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ale Saud did one more thing that they called Pakistan rulers to Saudi on one phone call. They are always ready to come on one call. One day Mohammad bin Salman will also say that they have taken 33 billion from us but not done anything. Trump has said this already and similarly Mohammad bin Salman will also have to say this one day that Pakistan has not done anything for us. For the Pakistan rulers if you are taking Rials from Saudi, then take but don&rsquo;t put Pakistan on the same direction as they want. Mohammad bin Salman wants rented people, labor, forces, and terrorists from Pakistan. He knows that entire Pakistan is on rent. This intellect should be there in Pakistan that they should not go on rent and don&rsquo;t do whatever they want to do.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>End of Fitnah in Iran</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/end%20of%20iran%20fitnah.png" alt="" width="301" height="190" />As regards to Iran; last week has been a distressful week in Iran. The people there on the basis of price inflation of commodities, which is said due to economic sanctions applied by USA; some of them protested with anti-government slogans and also slogans against sanctities. But day before yesterday on Wednesday; the same way like in 2009 the entire Iranian community came out on street for demonstrations to end the Fitnah; the same was done again now to end this Fitnah. I have been discussing about this subject since a long time; that the Iranian people will be bought under pressure and aroused against government. This weakness is there in Iran that the people get influenced with difficulties. They need more welfare and if there is shortfall they object. The sanctions are that tool which America understood late. By applying sanctions, restrictions they foiled the atomic plan of Iran. The Iranian community has proved that they get highly disturbed with sanctions and America also knows that it is with sanctions that they can inflict blow on Iran. If Iranians get affected by sanctions then America knows that this is the tool they should use. With sanctions, international cash flow stops, relations with other nations are cut off; the basic necessities don&rsquo;t reach people and they face difficulties then rise against the government. Then whatever Trump and America wants the people start to do. This is the policy of America to keep people under economic pressure and then arouse them to stand against the government. This weakness is found in Iran that on one hand there are those who are not afraid of bullets, martyrdom, missiles and fighting in Iraq and Syria. Then there is another group of people who are afraid of scarcity of bread and they are the ones who make more noise and give more damage. But with all praises to God, just like before they got ashamed. On Wednesday the entire nation came out in support of Leader and the system; this way this entire Fitnah got eliminated. Ale Saud did a big investment for these riots in Iran. They wanted to move the battle inside Iran and wanted to teach Iran a lesson inside. The Arab media has raised these protests and riots a lot. There would be few people in protests, riots but media showed in big way. But Allah has defeated them again.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1515505016Muslim-World.jpg', '', '1515475822Political_Analysis_of_the_Week_-_5th_Jan_2018.pdf', 'A', NULL, '2018-08-16 13:30:58', 'Y');

The foolish, accursed, corrupt Trump had declared this Friday (today) to announce the suspension of this agreement and America will formally break out from this. There was a meeting between European members yesterday and they have requested Trump to respect and continue this agreement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The nuclear agreement was done with Iran which was due to the nuclear energy development by Iran which as per Iran claims was for peaceful purpose. There were global sanctions of various forms imposed on Iran as pressure tactics whereby Iran was forced to restrict their nuclear enrichment activities. They pursued Iran for this with these sanctions. The sanctions created internal difficulties for Iran and an example of this was seen recently where some people protested for economic issues which were due to these sanctions. This was what they wanted and there are certain elements present inside Iran as well both inside government and outside who apply this tactic of creating pressure of sanctions on Iran. They apply this tactic and have seen that Iran submits against sanctions. The Iranians have not submitted against any other challenge or difficulty but against economic sanctions they submit. Some Iranian politicians have also said that Iran should change its policies in lieu of the demands which America is making. They applied sanctions on Iran to make it change their policy and these sanctions were effective.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The foremost effect was on suspension of nuclear development on Iran. They shutdown many of their reactors, they sealed some reactors by filling cement inside the plants; they closed down some centrifuges and sold some ready nuclear enrichment products to the outside world as per the agreement. They made Iran do all this with these pressures and now America is accusing Iran that since Iran is spreading terrorism in the region, it is not ending its missile technology and does not listen to America. Whatever plans America make Iran diffuses them like America made ISIS in the region and Iran uprooted them. In this annoyance, frustration the same nuclear agreement which America forced Iran to sign and now America is walking out of this. As it is night over there, when Friday starts over there Trump will be making a formal announcement. The European Union have applied pressure and requested him to reconsider his decision.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump wants to make the entire world disturbed, distressed, non-peaceful. They have already done this but want to take this global insecurity to its peak. The dangers which America is facing today; they only see this way out that is to create crisis in the world and then reap benefits out of these crisis. This is an old formula of theirs and successful also to keep the world in chaos, crisis and then keep on taking benefits of it. They did this with Middle East; now they are trying to create crisis for China and also trying create more severity for the already ongoing crisis. There is a Persian proverb and all this is happening just like this proverb. That proverb is to make the water unclean and then catch fish. If you are catching fish in clean water then fish can see you and runs away. This is the political policy of America that you cannot reap benefits out of a peaceful world. If they want to take some benefits out from Pakistan they cannot do it from a peaceful Pakistan or similarly from Iran and the whole world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefits and interests of America first is their global dominance and no one in the world should be independent, everyone should be under them; whatever they order the entire world should listen and act on them. The entire world&rsquo;s wealth, capital, oil, gas, energy should be their property. They want to make the internal policies for everyone in the world and all internal issues should be in the hands of America. This is not acceptable by every community and when they don&rsquo;t fulfill this intention of America; they keep them under pressure, crisis and try to reap benefits this way. They did the same with Arabs and transformed them into a fat milking cow. They are selling weapons to them which the American companies are making. If there are no wars, then the weapons will not be sold. Hence they create crisis and these accursed, insane, foolish Arabs fall under their deceit very quickly as per American policies they make the region also insecure and give them all the benefits America wants from them. But Iran becomes an obstacle for America. When America tries to make room for itself, gets inside some country bringing them under pressure Iran starts to support that country and the people there; and the people rebel against America. Hence America is severely annoyed and angry on Iran and Pakistan but for different reasons. They are angry on Iran because Iran foils the American plans in the region. For Pakistan America is angry because Pakistan is not listening to America and what America wants them to do they are not doing it the same way. The groups on which America wants them to put restrictions they don&rsquo;t do; the regions in which America wants them to carry out operations they don&rsquo;t do. Hence America is severely annoyed with them. They have given 48 hours deadline to Pakistan but for Iran they are ready to sign the decision about abandonment of agreement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With the end of this agreement it is not just a paper will become void instead all these things which America agreed related to Iran as per this agreement will become void. Like America committed to not start a war with Iran, they will not take any steps against Iran but all these will end now and America will be free to do any mischief against Iran. They have full freedom against Iran and America can do anything to inflict blows on Iran. They can impose more sanctions on Iran and create more difficulties for Iran. This weakness of Economic sanctions also has been shown by Iranians only to America from which they are taking undue advantages. The revolutionary group in Iran are self-contented and they are not worried about anything, they are loyal to the system. But everyone in Iran is not revolutionary; there is a big group which had nothing to do in bringing this revolution and not concerned at all with what will happen to this revolution. They are the type of grazing creatures who are only interested in acquiring worldly means, they are after lavish living and for them values do not carry any importance. For them dignity, freedom has no meaning; they want oil at cheaper prices and other things. It is natural that when there are economic sanctions it results into inflation and essential commodities become expensive and they don&rsquo;t get or get less; they take advantage of these and get into protests. The actual target of America is not the nuclear of Iran but it is the Islamic Revolution and System of Wilayat e Faqeeh. They want to enhance the pressure and thus chaos inside Iran due to which more people will rise against the government and then America, European Union would help the people and their long term desire of ending this Islamic government and replacing it with a liberal government should get fulfilled. Since forty years more than forty such big mischiefs have been done by America and in all of these America has been defeated in a disgraceful manner. The last big mischief of theirs was making ISIS in Syria and the disgraceful manner in which they got defeated cannot be seen anywhere in history whereby a big superpower has been disgraced before in this manner. And God willing they will be further disgraced.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump is the icon of disgrace for America today. It is there in tradition as well when tyranny, oppression will reach its peak a character will be seen before the reappearance of our Last Imam (a.t.f.s). That character is that of Dajjal. Dajjal is a character in Islamic teachings that will come into appearance before the establishment of a global just governance. Dajjal is a negative character present in the Islamic teachings and there are traditions from Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s), Infallible Imams (a.s). It is a commonly agreed character who will appear before the Last Imam (a.t.f.s) and he will be uprooted by believers and then a global government of divine justice that is of Mahdaviat will be established. This is a common belief of all Muslims whereby Dajjal is the peak of tyranny. The Fitnah of Dajjal which is common belief amongst Muslims and lot of research has been done on this; with many books also written on this from all sects. This character has two types of interpretations.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of them is that Dajjal is a known individual who is like man but somewhat abnormal with one eye. He will come in this world, create big corruption and make the entire world insecure, instable. Then to end this<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/trump-122.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" /> Fitnah a group of believers will rise against him, uproot this Fitnah of Dajjal and then Imam (a.t.f.s) will reappear and then after this there will be system of peace, safety across the globe. This is one interpretation that Dajjal is a known individual.The other interpretation is that Dajjal is not an individual but a character that can come in various forms and faces to create a Fitnah. If Dajjal is a character then we can say that Trump is the Dajjal of this era because his plan is to indulge the entire world in chaos and crisis. In this case even though he will take tyranny, oppression to the peak but he will get destroyed by the hands of believers and the ground will get prepared for the System of Imamat whereby all political systems of the world will end. That is democracy, Kingship, dictatorship will all end and across East and West the only system that will prevail would be the System of Imamat; whose name is Mahdaviat. If we see from this perspective the policies which Trump is making the Americans are more frustrated than anyone else with him. Even Iran and Pakistan are not disturbed to the extent the Americans are annoyed with Trump because of the policies he has made. He wants to get into conflicts with Atomic powers like he wants to fight China, Russia, and North Korea. All the three are big atomic powers and even one of them has that much atomic weapons base that they can destroy the entire world and Trump wants to fight with them. The Americans have become highly annoyed and are finding out ways on how to tighten Trump. But the global Satanic System demands that Trump only has to stay. There is a book (<em>Fire and Fury)</em> published about Trump in which his foolish and insane acts are written. He tried to restrict the printing of this book but somehow it got published. All his foolishness are mentioned in this book amongst this one thing mentioned is that when he won the elections he did not believed that he would win, because the lady against him got more votes, but the Satanic global powers wanted Trump to become President hence they made him. They wanted through him to create all chaos, destruction in the four years and then after this he will get disgraced by the believers. It was impossible for him to believe that he will win the elections but since it was decided that he has to come and carry out all these foolishness.</p>', 'N', 'N', '1515770665e.jpg', 'iNIBCr4e_QQ', '1515766889trump.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-16 02:17:58', 'Y'),

Now our rulers have become attentive that how destructive is the friendship with America and even the people have become attentive that friendship with America is very dangerous. This has happened first time but we are not prepared to declare our stand against them. Our rulers have taken some time to decide whereas he is abusing Pakistan every day and coming out with new blames every day. It will take some time for Pakistanis to rise against America. Trump has trigged this and that not just Pakistan but entire Muslim world should rise against them. For Pakistan he has strengthened his relationship with India and that is also for confronting China. Trump has stopped all aids for Pakistan. The Pakistan agencies have said that we have discounted intelligence information cooperation relationship with America and if this has really happened then this has been a big step taken in the history of Pakistan. If this has happened then this should not remain only up to slogan and you should practically break all cooperation with America as that would be basis of peace and stability in Pakistan.

This capacity is present in politics but in religious persons this is not there. A politician will accuse anther politician as corrupt, traitor etc. but will not declare his opponent as someone infidel and obligatory to be killed. But for non-political religious groups that have jumped into elections everyone becomes infidel and obligatory to be killed.

One beastly person molested an 8 yrs old girl child then killed her after which he dumped the body into Garbage. When the body was found it outraged the people, demonstrations were done, which police tried to stop and as a result few persons were killed. This is happening since few days and today is Friday and it might become further tense. This is not a new incident in Pakistan; this is happening every day with only difference being that it does not comes up in news. The way the culture of Pakistan has become which is full of lust, incitation of lustful passion, moral corruption and in this culture there are thousands such cases happening every day and not that this one case has happened in Kasur.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has been a grievous incident for this girl being killed in this state but as I said this happens daily in Pakistan. But more grievous than the incident it is the <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8yr-1.png" alt="" width="315" height="178" />political color that has been given to this issue and has been made a political case. The political groups are now using this by doing protests, sit-ins all for their own organizational benefits. These politicians are filthy who do the politics on the dignity of someone. This is disgraceful, humiliated and shameful politics. There are some who do politics on corpses. Wherever they see a corpse they will reach there. They do not take any step to stop these crimes. They do not think, plan or take any step in this direction to purify the society from such crimes. They don&rsquo;t do any Amr Bil Maroof, Nahi Anal Munkar, no admonitions, preaching, religious counselling, education, upbringing and nothing. It is evident when there is a beastly jungle atmosphere then this will happen. When small children have got corruption in their hands in form of mobile phones; when corruption has reached inside their homes; when the mothers, sisters of young children are corrupting them, nudity is there but the politicians do not speak on this nudity, corruption, vulgarity that is spreading; they do not raise any voice on these issues in Assembly, no voice comes from political groups. They wait for such lustful crimes to happen, after which corpses should fall and then they jump over the corpses to stand against government for the sake of their own power. They play with the dignity and respect of the people and this is much bigger oppression than the molestation, murder of that young girl and this is what is starting now.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have mentioned that the cultural atmosphere of Pakistan has been destroyed. There has been completely destruction of values and ethics by the capitalist and illegitimate money makers. They have started illegal trades whereby they have adulterated the entire atmosphere and this has gone up to those regions where we cannot imagine that such corruption, impurity would ever reach there. When we see examples from such regions as well also like if we see Gilgit, Baltistan is a pure region as it is mostly cut off from rest of the country but they have adulterated them as well. There also the corruption in which young children have been indulged is highly disturbing. Similarly young children of other city; Karachi, Lahore and of cities of Punjab, Sindh and other places are indulged into corrupt acts but neither media, rulers, government, religious groups, political parties are attentive towards this. They have all prepared for the Fitnah of election and everyone including religion, scholars are busy with that. If there is no Nahi Anal Munkar and means to stop this corruption then such incidents will keep on happening on daily basis and above these incidents is the worst politics that is done. We need to be attentive towards but it is of no use to demand in Pakistan. From whom we should demand in this country?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If we have to demand then we should demand from the common people. They should protect their children as this era is more dangerous than that of Pharaoh to destroy the young generation. This is highly dangerous era and what kind of severely dreadful arrangements have been made to destroy our generations. I will mention this in separate discussion on what kind of dangerous conspiracy is there in Pakistan and other countries in this context. India is much more drowned in this matter as compared to Pakistan that it is becoming impossible for women to come out of their homes. The Indians are becoming so blind in lust and Pakistanis are also following them. Though not like India but situation here also is dangerous and on the other hand everyone else is involved in Politics and have become pioneers of Politics. They raise political slogans and scholars have left Tableegh, Amr Bil Maroof and Nahi Anal Munkar. The Parents have left their responsibilities and have themselves involved into lustful corruption hence their children also adopt the same. When you arouse lust; like when nude women come out in the streets. They bring young children in semi-nude dresses in markets in winter. This is wrong. When someone gets killed and this oppression reaches to its peak then you will come out? When a young child is killed now you have started to burn vehicles, breaking into banks, shattering windows; what kind of foolishness is this? What kind of community you are? The child got killed and they attacked the police station as if the police has done all this. If the police has not given security and have done some mistakes then also this politics which is being played is not acceptable. In order to resolve these issue you rectify your judiciary system, make arrangement and more important than all this is to reform the family environment. If that gets rectified than all these incidents which are happening on daily basis will finish. The situation under the dust is very dangerous. We cannot trust anyone that on the outward this person has a religious attire but it is possible that this element of lust is aroused inside himself. This is happening also every other day in religious madrassa, places and by people.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This incident is repeating in multiple forms and this corruption needs to be stopped in form of a movement. Just like to stop terrorism we need a movement similarly for this lustful corruption also we need a movement. In terrorism they will kill some people but in this corruption everyone including, men, women, young, old will get destroyed. To stop this corruption we need one group who can do Amr Bil Maroof and Nahi Anal Munkar, reform the homes and pay attention towards it.&nbsp; We come out on the street to demand the government to protect our children. From what all the government can protect you? Is it in their capacity to do this? It is foolishness to even think about this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am relating you a real incident of a mother who came to us with a young child seeking admission in our seminary. The child was of primary class and younger than the minimum age required for admission. We apologized and denied the request as we cannot manage such a young child. This is the age when the child should be with mother and mothers at this age do not want their child to separate but she started to plead, cry and was about to fall on my feet. Then we stopped her from doing like and I became inquisitive to ask her why you are so keen to get your child&rsquo;s admission done immediately as at this age mother won&rsquo;t like to separate from her child. She replied that I want to save the life of my child and if you don&rsquo;t give admission he will die. I want to protect the child. We asked from whom? The mother replied from his father. With apologies to speak this, but the child was also there with his mother. She said till now the father of this child has molested him several times. When mother, father have their lust aroused to this extent, do you think police will stop them? Whose responsibility is to stop all this?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/8yr-2.png" alt="" width="315" height="157" />We should cut the roots of corruption, close the doors of corruption, shut down the source of corruption. These telecom companies are the foremost in spreading this vulgarity and corruption. They are giving such high speed internet to children. You have yourself made the arrangement of corruption and when the incident happens then start to play merciless, beastly politics on the oppressed, victimized body. This is shameful, disgraceful and being Pakistani we all should feel disgraced about this. We are all responsible for not doing anything to stop such corruption. The methods of stopping corruption are not processions, but it lies in reformation of family life and controlling the roots of corruption. In Europe they have forbidden Children to use mobile below 18 yrs but here everthing is open. We have open the doors more than the corrupt societies. This evil has spread inside every home.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am requesting the youths as well to protect yourself and also others, society as well. All these children are your sanctities and to protect these sanctities is our responsibility and it should not happen like India. Today the situation of India is such that if some women wants to travel to India they threaten her that the moment you step down from the flight you will get molested. This is because corruption is open, free there and everyone is burning in the fire of corruption. The lusts have aroused for every men and women there. How will you cool down this aroused corruption? We should only express our hatred, annoyance towards these molestation acts? We should start a movement against this. Whatever they want they are running on Cable TV, on WhatsApp, the telecom companies are doing whatever they want and when an aggression happens then we cry that this filthy act has taken place. This media is also responsible for these crimes and sins. We should consider the children of other as our own children. In yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper it was there that similar incident took place in Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha and very few newspapers publish this. There also they molested children and murdered them. If someone is killed after this act then it comes in newspaper and if killing is not done then people out of honor do not inform anyone and just suffer. We need to rise against this culture and this disgrace. The scholars who have to do this have stepped inside politics and have left their scholarly duties due to which this filth is coming out. We pray to Allah to protect the dignity of all Muslims from these beasts; may Allah destroy the centers who are promoting and may Allah severely punish those who are doing this oppression on children.</p>', 'N', 'N', '15157675963.jpg', 'gXBNVV8aJwQ', '15157675968_yrs_girl_murdered.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-16 02:19:51', 'Y'),

Generally such diplomatic trips are not so long but he went for six days and has visited various cities. This news is very important for Pakistan but astonishingly we have not taken this seriously and not taken any notice. Neither our media, government, public have shown any importance; and neither do the political, religious groups as they are busy in their own protests work. They do not realize what is happening in their neighborhood and what sensitivity it has for them. The Israeli Prime Minister is visiting India with a delegation of 130 persons mostly traders of weapons companies and security equipment&rsquo;s, and he is making contracts there. India and Israel are big trade partners. After America for Israel the biggest trade partner is India. As regards to weapons India is the biggest buyer from Israel. Israel makes the most dangerous weapons and India purchases from them first.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;But the most important reason for this visit is to use the Israeli experience of Palestine in Kashmir by India. But we have not seen any sensitivity towards this in Pakistan and even of ordinary nature. The community of Pakistan are as such blind followers and go after wherever media takes them. The community gets up on non-issue but on big issues they remain silent because media has not said anything. Israel coming on the border of Pakistan is very dangerous. Pakistan is the only atomic power in the Islamic world. And Israel is the biggest enemy of Muslims and they don&rsquo;t tolerate Atomic power present in any Muslim country. Some countries that did Israel got them attacked and destroyed their atomic power bases like in Iraq; they destroyed the atomic plant in Libya, Syria and are attacking Sudan. They destroyed everywhere and only Pakistan is left. As per some past news Israel has made the plans several times to destroy the atomic plants of Pakistan. A news that came on Social media which I don&rsquo;t know if that is authentic or not but kept on moving on social media for long time that they have got over a Pakistani pilot through whom they wanted to destroy the Pakistan&rsquo;s atomic power. Israel knows that if any Muslim country has atomic weapon; even if that is not used anywhere else it will be fore sure used on Israel. Hence India and Israel are both staunch enemies of Pakistan and they are firming up their relationships.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/netanyahu-2.png" alt="" width="275" height="178" />The Indian Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s identity is of Muslim enmity and his enmity of Pakistan, Muslims Islam is not hidden from anyone. At present these both Anti-Islam state heads are sitting hand in hand and there is absolute silence in Pakistan on this. Israel is dangerous on several aspects in this region; the foremost being for Kashmir. From the time Modi has become Prime Minister of India the situation in Kashmir with Indian infiltration has seen big changes. The Indian forces have been carrying out operations, oppressions and interference in Kashmir since seventy years but in last two years there has been a big change and has become very much similar to what Israel is doing in Gaza and Palestinian areas. The same is being done by India in Kashmir. It is evident that daily several flights that run between India and Israel, whereby trading goods, merchants and others are moving in and out.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The way Pakistan has given many regions like Cholistan to Arabs and Gwadar to China. Similarly in India there is a specific big area has been given to Israel where only Israeli&rsquo;s are going there and Indians are not allowed to go there. Israeli forces are the world&rsquo;s most scared forces. They have twenty four hours fear that anytime an attack can happen and they will die. They have fear of Hezbollah, Iran and Palestine.<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/netanyahu-3.png" alt="" width="258" height="187" /> The forces that feel such kind of pressure they get mentally distressed. Israel forces are the world&rsquo;s most mentally disturbed forces. Hence they have taken a region in India where Israel forces go there for rest. They come here for holidays and feel peace in that region in India. They stay for long time and get relaxed.&nbsp; Israeli forces are biggest victim of drugs. They are drug addicted force. They are tyrannical and sexually corrupt. Israel takes woman from across the world and supplies to the forces, so that they stay in the army and don&rsquo;t run away. These licentious girls from different countries are supplied to the forces, so that they are busy and don&rsquo;t run away. They are allowed to drink, do corruption with such women and this is a big business in Israel to supply such women in Israel. They always have the fear and tension of Palestinians. We cannot assess this because security is a big bounty. If you see Pakistan even we are much better collectively. Israelis cannot sleep, they have to take medicines. In order to keep their forces intact they have to do all this and India supports them a lot to preserve their forces. They have given their full region to them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">America has prepared India for encountering China. America is massaging India like a wrestler to get them out in the ring with China. Trump as such is the owner of the Wrestling Company in America and other are women trafficking. <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/netanyahu-4.png" alt="" width="264" height="150" />He has this experience of wrestling business as to how they make the body of a person like a bull and he is an actor. They just do acting and foolish people see and then feel that a very dangerous fight is going on. Trump is massaging India as per his wrestling principles to get into encounter with China. China has given a warning yesterday to India on some silly steps India took that be careful you foolish people, this will cost you a lot. China is not like before, they have become very aggressive and not like before that they will step back. They are ready for an encounter with America. China has prepared their warfare and invested a lot and developing a political influence in the region and wants its military warfare better then America and Russia.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;From the time Israel and Modi has allied, the tone of India against Pakistan has changed. You can read your Pakistani newspaper there is a firing going every day on Pakistan border. Everyday Pakistani soldiers get killed. They are also replying but India starts it. India provokes the Pakistan forces and want Pakistan to take such step as a result of which they can attack aggressively. India has taken the complete borders of Pakistan under their control due to the internal issues of Pakistan and our borders have become insecure. A long border is directly with India; the other border is with Afghanistan where India has reached. The third border is of Iran with whom India has made good relationship whereas Pakistan has spoiled that relationship. The only border that is left is of China. Now India has started to provoke Pakistan. And Pakistan has also hopes from China that they will save them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Israeli Prime Minister coming for six days in this context is for a long term plan to carry out military and business contracts, and provide services for crushing Muslims. All this is for Muslims only because one common point between India and Israel is<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/netanyahu-5.png" alt="" width="280" height="162" /> enmity of Muslims. There is other common point also between India and Israel which will also bring them more closely is that both are against Christianity and enemies of Christians.&nbsp; Hindus are very sensitive about Christians more than the sensitivity they have for Muslims. And the Jews also are equally sensitive about Christians. Hence Israel has found an alternative friend also because Europe is also Christians. In future if the European friends isolate Israel on the basis of religion then Israel has another firm friend who is partner to Israel in enmity against Christianity as well. Hence this friendship of Israel and India is dangerous for both Pakistan and Muslims.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1516363428Image.jpg', 'WoPwnNHJMow', '1516363428netanyahu.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-21 20:42:20', 'Y'),

They are trying to make use of everything to reach their purpose. Even if there is an aggression done on a child they use that as well for their political interests. If there is some social matter, even if there is a weather issue they will use that as well against the government to start strikes and there is a peak of political instability. There are four months left for elections but the power hungry, lustful for power are not ready to wait even for few months. As such the country is victim of political instability and on top of that they are triggering such issue to trouble the people, the nation and worsening the economic situation. On top of that the role of media is such that they have created a storm of destruction. There are non-serious leaders, parties and media who until yesterday were abusing each other as criminals, thieves, dacoits and were ready to kill each other but are today standing on the same stage as allies. This is the satanic politics of Pakistan where religious with non-religious are doing alliance and people not possessing Taqwa are sacrificing religion, dignity all for politics. They are using the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) also in politics. They are asking vote in the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One government ignorant person did some change in the election pledge document; in that the statement of I swear was changed to I accept so as to create some room for another sect and on this the political parties came out and did what all they could do; and for the opposition it turned into political issue and they played a lot. Now that has become an issue and they are seeking vote in the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). The one who does not votes for them will be considered as the enemy of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). When they have made their slogan in the elections the name of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) and so one who does not votes for them will be considered as the enemy of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). They have already announced the verdict for the enemy of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s). They have made a slogan in protests that &ldquo;Gustakh<em> e Nabi ki his ek his saza, Sar tan se Juda</em>&rdquo; (Punishment for one who insults the Prophet is beheading). This is the verdict they have issued. So who is the one who will insult the Prophet? One who does not votes for their party. And his punishment will be beheading. This is the politics they are playing. Every sect is using some sanctities of religion. Some will seek vote in the name of Companions of Prophet, some in the name of Prophet, some in the name of Ahlulbayt. Now all these will become political parties; that is companions will be one party; Ahlulbayt another party and Prophet another party. They will be introduced as political parties. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s) will be sacrilege in the elections and then they are preparing to behead each other. There was a filthy politics that was already going on but has developed severity.

The labor workers stand at their depot in morning where they get daily work and the attack was done there in Baghdad and big number of martyrdoms took place. In Iraq even though the ISIS control has been taken over but still terrorists are present and strong at various locations and the difficulty of Iraq is that the Iraqi government is not independent, they are under dominance of America.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The movement of anti-terrorism which started effectively in Iraq, specifically with Hashad us Shabi, the peoples force played an important role by cleansing terrorism spots from the country. Now there is an international pressure and specifically Ale Saud wants to end them. All forces or Arab, America, West, Israel are united to somehow end two groups in the region; one is Hezbollah in Lebanon and second is Hashad us Shabi, they want to unarm them and transform them as political groups. In Lebanon it is not easy as Hezbollah is strong but in Iraq those sitting above Hashad us Shabi listen to outsiders, come under pressure, and take decisions also and such things can happen, though such signs are not seen yet and they don&rsquo;t want to end this force. Since political parties, religious leaders are harassed by Hashad us Shabi. This is because with Hashad us Shabi present no one will get a chance to play in Iran and this way Hashad us Shabi will take full control. Then the same same status of Hashad us Shabi will become like that of Hezbollah in Lebanon. If Hashad us Shabi becomes a big power in Iraq then it will be a problem for the Iraqi leadership and also for other political parties as they cannot do what they are doing now when an armed force is present inside. Hence there is a pressure on them to end Hashad us Shabi.

It was statement presented and given <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/message%20of%20pak.png" alt="" width="300" height="150" />the title of &ldquo;Message of Pakistan&rdquo; (Paigham-e-Pakistan). This message was signed by 1839 scholars of various sects; Deobandi, Barelvi, Ahle Hadith, Shias and all other sects. This is a common statement of 1839 scholars which government has prepared against terrorism and suicide bombing which has besieged Pakistan since thirty years. Now they have prepared this statement from scholars and the President has declared this as a formal state statement and has got the status of constitution. In this statement after thirty years they have declared suicide bombing, terrorism and killing people in the name of Islam as forbidden (Haraam). In this Jihad has been declared as the rights of the government and no one else can declare Jihad. This statement has been issued after thirty years and they have got it signed by scholars and presented to the world as a state level statement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a good step though the names of the scholars are not mentioned yet. If there are 1839 scholars who have signed against terrorism then if you want to get the signatures of those who favor terrorism then there would be 18,390 scholars who will sign in favor considering the situation of Pakistan. If you see from where terrorism has sprouted in Pakistan then those in favor are much more. There would be some who will sign on both in favor and against terrorism. It has been mentioned in this statement that one who does Jihad without state permission will be considered as rebellion. The government is expressing this step in a big way as if it was the last nail in the coffin of Terrorism and now terrorism will completely end. This is false imagination but at a collective level this is a good step but to think that terrorism will end with this is simplicity. In Pakistan terrorism is deeply rooted and Terrorism has its own roots and causes. Terrorism did not started with one statement so how can it end with one statement. Statement is something good and we testify the step taken by the government and scholars is correct even though it is late after thirty years. This is simplicity and raw thinking that with this statement terrorism will end in Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Terrorism in Pakistan is quite matured and it has acquired the status of a school of thought in Pakistan. This means it has become a firm vision and there are supporters of this vision. There are many governmental and non-governmental elements involved in this. They have taken a lot of efforts to nurture and establish terrorism and that is not something normal. The literates, media, Army generals, education institutes, scholars, people, Madrassah&rsquo;s, businessman have played a dreadful, scary role in terrorism. They have made Pakistan as a school for terrorism, a method has been established and from here they have spread Terrorism across the world and amongst the Arabs. They came from there only but used this land, the people, parties, means and this is how they penetrated terrorism in Pakistan. There has nothing else that has penetrated so deeply in Pakistan other than terrorism. After this keeping this expectation that terrorism will end with a statement is simplicity. We can consider the statement as a first step amongst the reasonable steps but after this the next steps are to be taken.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have already mentioned this always that any battle which is started against any Fitnah or terrorism; if that is against its effects and consequences will be failed battle. This is an intellectual and philosophical principle that any battle that is fought against effects, results and outcomes will be unsuccessful. Like malaria is spread through mosquitoes and if you start a battle against malaria and not mosquitoes this will never be successful. If Malaria is spread with mosquitoes then you have to fight against Mosquitoes. In philosophy there are terminologies &ldquo;Illat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Malool&rdquo;. &ldquo;Illat&rdquo; means the cause and &ldquo;Malool&rdquo; are the effects, results of that cause. Like Malaria is caused by mosquitoes, or by drinking adulterated water Hepatitis disease spreads. We don&rsquo;t remove the adulteration of water but instead start an encounter against Hepatitis. This is an unsuccessful battle. The way this is a failure in diseases, weather, atmosphere similarly in community affairs and even in economy this is a failed battle to fight with effects and results rather than cause. This is a common intellectual, philosophical principle that wherever there is a cause for any crisis and if you target the effect and don&rsquo;t touch the cause then be assured that you will fail. You have to start a battle with the cause.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There has been a fight against terrorism in Pakistan but now an intention has been made. This intention has been<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/message%20of%20pak-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" /> made late and that too with non-intellectual reasons. It is not due to sympathy with community and nation. It is for some commercial benefits because some countries like China who are investing money in Pakistan have put up his condition that we will not invest in Pakistan unless terrorism ends in Pakistan. Hence you have now made this intention that we have to end terrorism. But you have made this intention after thirty years that terrorism should end. For thirty years either you have enhanced it or supported it or remained indifferent to it which has given big losses. Now when you have made this intention then it is necessary to start the encounter against the causes of terrorism. The causes are multiple if we express in details. But what I have already mentioned before that there are three major root causes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One is the Takfirist thinking which gives the vision that anyone who does not thinks like us is an infidel and obligator to kill. Everyone knows who has this thinking, which school has this vision and where are their centers. Even now also those centers have the same thinking. 1839 scholars have issued the statement that terrorism is Haraam, shedding blood is forbidden, suicide bombing is Haraam but they have not written that to declare Muslims as infidel is also Haraam and to declare Muslims as obligatory to kill also as Haraam. They have not written anything about the school which possesses this vision. Thus I said that in this statement there are many who have supported terrorism and now they are doing hypocrisy by aligning with the government to declare this as Haraam. Are they not the same persons who openly supported terrorism? Have you forgotten their conferences on media? They were the faces who said that the Pakistani soldiers who get killed in fighting with Taliban are not martyrs and Taliban are martyred. They declared terrorists as martyred and they are ones who have signed on both sides. If these 1839 are like this then we should bid farewell on this. If they are those who are not ready to even given the title of Martyrs to those crusading soldiers of Army, police, FC who gave their lives in fighting terrorists. This statement would become ineffective if such kind of faces are present.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Pakistan this statement deserves to say that shedding blood of any human being is a crime and rebellion with state and should be considered as betrayal by law and law should punish them. Then the terrorism can end in Pakistan. But these centers were not touched, all their setups are in place. The places which are mother of terrorism and from where the verdicts of Shia Kafir (infidels) are issued are still in palace. Have you nullified all those past verdicts? First nullify all the verdicts (Fatwa&rsquo;s) that were related to Shias declaring them as infidels (Kafir). Get those Muftis in front of media and ask them to do repentance and ask for forgiveness for the verdicts they have issued. They should seek forgiveness from the entire community and state, then the state can forgive them. Then this will be become the fight against the causes of terrorism.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The second cause for terrorism is state sponsorship. Few months ago the country&rsquo;s state agency has given the name of 77 persons of Parliament, MNA as supporters of terrorism. This is not what I am saying or media is saying; the list has been issued by the secret agency of Pakistan in which the current Pakistan government member&rsquo;s names are also there. These members protested also that how their names are issued. When a government parliament has 77 persons from 250 member Parliament then what can we say. In Jhang elections the son of a big terrorist contested for elections and neither the government, election council, Supreme Court nor anyone else stopped him and he won with big majority. Those who confess that we are terrorists and we will do this but no one stopped them and they went into parliament. This means you accept that terrorism is sponsored by state, they are supported by the state for the sake of votes and other interests. This is a big cause which should be ended. Till date in Pakistan not a single case has been filed on a government officer for supporting terrorism. First bring their names out, punish them, and seize all their wealth, property. If you want to end terrorism then control this group which is supporting, sponsoring and promoting terrorism.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the foreign countries; there are two types of supporters of terrorism; one are the friend nations and others are enemies. The friendly nations<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalwindow.com/uploaded/message%20of%20pak-3.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" /> have given more damages to Pakistan then the enemies. The enemy nations are India and Israel who have supported terrorism in Pakistan. But the friend country has done bigger destruction then enemies. In this specifically the Arab nations. Who does not know what the Arabs have done with their filthy accursed money in Pakistan and how they financed terrorism in Pakistan Is any Arab nation given warning till date? Is any Arab embassy been stopped? Is any Arab money stopped from coming here? Every day there is a government and non-government statement that if something happens with Ale Saud we will support. Every day they call you and you go there. They send money and take from here any person they want to. Then how can terrorism end in Pakistan. If you want to end terrorism then control the roots and if we assume that it can end with statements then this is false imagination. As I said this intention is present there in Pakistan to end terrorism, but this you have to come all out, the state should use all powers and the biggest power of the state is the community. The people&rsquo;s power should be used to stop terrorism. People should be awakened and they can do this. But they need terrorist groups. The terrorist groups do programs in the name of Defense of Pakistan, everyone in the world knows they are terrorists then how can we end terrorism.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are other causes like senselessness of people, Western affiliation, poverty, unemployment, lack of education, useless rulers, failure of educational institutes are big causes. First it was Madrassahs but now terrorism has moved into universities. Since past two years no terrorist has been caught from Madrassah and all have been arrested from universities. From big known private and government universities. Those who carried out big terrorist operations were university graduates. The last incident of terrorism that took place in Pakistan was done by PHD doctor; professor of Karachi University did the terrorist attack.&nbsp; So can terrorism can end with this steps of statement. It is true that establishment has an intention to end terrorism but this intention should become a communal intention. The people of Pakistan are unconcerned, despaired and they have a very strange state that they do not participate in anything. They just wait for their turn of death as to when it comes. The step which they have to take they are not prepared for that. The state, scholars and educational institutes should awaken the people so that for the sake of nation, community and for their own survival this people&rsquo;s awakening can end terrorism from Pakistan.</p>', 'N', 'N', '1516375241Image-4.jpg', '7S75XHst9Zk', '1516375020Message_oof_ok.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-20 01:59:21', 'Y'),

Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Russia destroyed them. The actual decisive stage came with the involvement of Russia but the resistance shown by the three was phenomenal. The battle that was started for 21 days and they wanted to finish Syria in 21 days, end the Bashar government , establish a Takfiristan and then move towards Iraq. But now in 5 yrs also they could not do it, they got defeated, killed, some of their forces have ran away and very little area of Syria is left which are only those areas where some American forces, Kurd and Turkish forces are there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">America is trying a new conspiracy now by making a new force with Kurds against the Syrian government and this force will be set up with American support and they will again start a new phase of Fitnah and insecurity in Syria. This is a very dangerous announcement which they have done. As I said before the most effective and last card for America and European Union is Kurd Fitnah as rest all cards have failed. This card they will use and make the region insecure. The Kurds are settled around four countries; Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey; and America has promised them to make a new nation for them as Kurdistan. America is supporting all the Kurds in these four countries. In Iraq they tried also to get a referendum done but they got defeated and Barzani had to resign also. Turkey has resisted strongly that if America tries to make this force we will destroy it in its sperm itself. Iran also has given strong statement that we all will attack in the first step only and destroy this Fitnah. Similar statement has been issued by Syria as well. Iraq is silent since their government is more under American influence. But these three countries have openly declared that if this force is made we will destroy it in the initial stages itself and not allow it to be made.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">America wants to break the four countries and divide them into Kurd and Non Kurd. It is necessary that these four countries should unite and they are almost united expect Syria and Turkey; which is also being resolved through Russia and Turkey has changed its policy as regards to Syria. Russia is with these countries. As I said before also America wants to start one front against china and another against Russia. China is preparing in one way and Russia also is preparing in another way. China has almost taken Pakistan out from America and relationship with America for Pakistan is almost near to end in which China had a big role and is beneficial for Pakistan to break this relationship at the earliest.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Russia is increasing its power and also eyeing on Pakistan as well and Russia needs this strong force present in the region. China is eyeing on the Pakistan resources, market and the Russia is eyeing on the strong Pakistan army present in this region which can be used against America and they are also trying on their own to develop relationship with Pakistan. Russia wants to play a big role in international policy.&nbsp; You can keep this mind that Russia, China along with other nation are trying to end the global status of America and that status of America being the only global superpower has almost ended. With the policies of Trump the American status has further weakened and Russia wants to take big advantage of this situation. There is also a case going on in America whereby Russia has influenced the victory of Trump in America through campaigns on social media. Even if this is an exaggeration and not correct also, and if Russia has done this then this is a big achievement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Russia has always been under the pressure of American policies and it is first time that America has come under the policies of America. It is possible also because the current President of Russia; Vladimir Putin has been the head of KGB; the special and most dangerous secret agency of Russia and has been trained by the agencies. He is amongst the shrewdest politicians of this era. Since he has been trained by KGB he has more talent in intelligence activities as compared to others and cleverness. He has a strong conviction to break America and he is trying every possible tactic. He is trying to interfere inside America and also in other regions Russia is increasing the power to get into a big encounter with America and take revenge. Russia was Soviet Union, a big empire and not what it is now. It was broken up by America into various parts and they want to take revenge. Russia now says that we want to divide the 52 states of America into 52 countries and Russia has taken steps for this. America has been dominating the world by rowdiness and threats on nations and Russia now wants to take advantage of the same. As the media says Russia made Trump victorious so that Trump will make such policies which will give losses to America and give opportunities to other countries like China, Russia to come up in power. Till now the activities of Trump are proving that he is giving enough opportunity to these nations through his policies. Thus Russia also has interests in this area and Kurd nation will not be formed.</p>', 'N', 'N', '1516379181khurdh.png', '3KWby82KpiY', '1516377580Resistance_to_US_backed_Kurdish_force_in_Syria.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-20 01:58:38', 'Y'),

These days are the days of the birth anniversary of Lady Zainab (s.a). These days in reality are days of pledging and covenant. The character of Lady Zainab (s.a) which we generally have heard is in the field of calamites and pains. The moment the name of Lady Zainab (s.a) comes up we remember her calamites. There is no doubt that this lady has suffered a lot of calamities but her identity is Istiqamat (perseverance). For the sake of religion in toughest situations she has walked shoulder to shoulder with her brother and then after Sayyadus Shohada (a.s) she carried the divine trust on her shoulder which is the big achievement of this lady.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She is a highly prestigious, esteemed lady but we are not much aware about her personality because we just mourn on her and think that we have delivered the rights. We don&rsquo;t consider to be acquainted with the other dimensions of her personality. Lady Zainab (s.a) is a role model for everyone, men and women. She is the role model of awareness and awakening. When big companions, elderly personalities were in the state of confusion, denial and not clear Lady Zainab (s.a) herself recognized her duty and become member of this movement on her own traversing the most difficult stages of this uprising.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She was a scholar, qualified and a full role model of sense, perseverance, strong will and intention. The strong will power she had was abnormal and was not subject to dissolution. The incidents of hardships that took place did not had slightest influence on the will of this Lady and instead it became more firm. Women are generally sentimental and of weak will, intention by temperament. They become emotional in calamities but this lady from the day one participated voluntarily and emphasized to enter this encounter. It is necessary to make arrangement to open, study these models. The various stages of their life should be clear, they are the headlines which we should adopt and it is not enough that we only mourn for them. Till the time the shadow of their personality does not fall on our character we have not delivered their rights. We can say that what a Persian poet has presented is a very beautiful gift of belief for Lady Zainab (s.a). He says</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><em>Karbala Mi Murd agar Zainab na boodh<br /> Shi&rsquo;ey mi pajmurd agar Zainab na boodh</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Karbala would have died if Zainab would not be there<br /> Shia would have withered if Zainab not be there</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify;">Islam, Quran would have withered and abandoned if this Lady would not have been there. This lady has a very high stature but we have not gone beyond just mourning for her. We have not inferred the ideals from here personality. Her enlightenment has not developed amongst us. We have very weak intentions though we are associated with Imam Hussain (a.s), Karbala and Lady Zainab (s.a) but there is no proportion and comparison between the will power of this Lady and us. These are the dimensions which we should acquire from the role model of this Lady.</span></p>', 'N', 'N', '15172307871.jpg', 'hiXQyKbjKCE', '1517035483Inferring_Ideals_from_the_personality_of_Lady_Zainab.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-29 04:59:47', 'Y'),

The drone comes over our land, attacks and goes back but they don&rsquo;t have courage to stop them or bring it down with anti-aircraft weapons which they have.

Once someone has eaten 36 billion dollars in 15 yrs then they cannot even raise their eyes; this was eaten by the rulers and not by the Pakistani nation; they have not eaten 36 billion dollars. The Pakistani nation, people are also not replying to the humiliation done by America. The reason is the way the government has orientations and dependency on America the people are also like this only. Everyone wants to get Visa of America, they want to send their children to America to study and they want to settle there. They raise slogans of Death to America with their tongue but practically there is no reaction towards the disgraceful behavior which America has shown towards Pakistan. As if they have given the rights to Trump to do all this because they have paid this much money to us before. Trump has also said that those countries whom we give aids cannot participate in any voting against America in international organizations.

But in Palestine as well there are certain Mujahid&rsquo;s who have not yet sold the First Qiblah and Palestine.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'N', '1517206928h.jpg', 'tFSZIwhFp2E', '1517036951Israel_proposes_friendship_to_Pakistan.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-01-28 22:22:08', 'Y');

Few days back also there was an attack in a very secure area of Afghanistan from inside an Ambulance and <img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/1_1.png" alt="" width="300" height="189" />103 persons lost their lives. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> big attack in ten days that has taken place in Kabul. Afghanistan at present has become center of terrorism the way they first made Syria and Iraq. After being defeated, humiliated from Syria, Iraq they have gathered all their resources and bringing them to Afghanistan. The purpose of bringing them to Afghanistan is not just to make Afghanistan insecure but instead the first purpose is to target Pakistan and Iran followed by China and Russia. The top of the list target is Pakistan and Iran. The left over skeleton of ISIS has been transferred to Afghanistan and they have made new policies for Afghanistan. They will make Afghanistan insecure and spread this insecurity in the entire region. In the upcoming days there will be more severity in Afghanistan. The preparations that were being made since last two years have reached its completion.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are three entities in Afghanistan involved in this; one is the government that is puppet of America; the second group is Taliban and the third group is ISIS. Taliban is also an American group only but later they rebelled against America when it tried to control them. Then America made ISIS as the successor of Taliban in Syria, Iraq and was planning to make a Takfiristan government there and from there they will do operations and control everything. They will create Kurdistan, strengthen Israel; they will divide Turkey, Iran and Iraq into several small countries. This was their plan which totally failed and now the panic is there due to this failure on the American President and cabinet. Under this defeat they have turned towards Afghanistan and moving all forces there. The Taliban is against government and ISIS. ISIS is also against Taliban as well as government. Taliban is that group which established an Islamic infrastructure on the basis of religion and invited everyone but they failed. ISIS claimed their own Khilafat but that also failed and we all know the reasons for their failure. Now they have again returned back to the same first point. They have a blood thirsty army of Taliban and more than that is ISIS who have a big experience of blood shedding and they have means, resources. The government of Afghanistan is the puppet of America and ISIS is also under American control; the same way it was in Iraq whereby the Iraqi government and ISIS were both under America and they made them fight each other. The same thing they are now about to do in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Afghanistan very quick the terrorism will increase and will spread out of Afghanistan. The recent Kabul attack was the third in last ten days and Afghanistan Taliban has accepted the responsibility. Pakistan is blamed to be supporting the Afghan Taliban. They claim that groups like Haqqani network and likes of it are supported by Pakistan. There is a possibility that the terrorist operations that are happening in Pakistan is not done by Taliban but done by ISIS. They are accusing Taliban for this so that they can punish Pakistan for the same. 103 persons were killed in this operation done through an ambulance in front of Ministry of Interior. This is something beyond Taliban even though Taliban is also organized, beastly, and merciless and experienced force but since on Afghanistan there is complete of America. The foreign Ministry is the place where the attack took place which is under very high security where even a pedestrian cannot walk. It is highly controlled area in which two ambulances loaded with explosives entered. Since the entire city is under American control it is impossible that this happened without the involvement of America. It is not possible that in such a sensitive and secure place controlled by America, Taliban can enter with two ambulances. This has been done by America only. Prior to this the attack was done on intercontinental hotel and in last few months more than five thousand persons have become victims of these attacks.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">America will put all these operations in Kabul on the head of Pakistan. They will say Pakistan is doing all this and as a reply they will increase the severity of Drone attacks and from there they will take this case forward against Pakistan. America will trouble with Pakistan more and this is not because of Pakistan interference with Afghanistan but for the relation with China. All what America was doing in Pakistan is now taken over by China and this is unbearable for Pakistan. Hence the upcoming days are very important for Pakistan. It is a tough examination for Pakistan government, forces and even people because the Pakistani&rsquo;s have proved that they do not take the right decision. They don&rsquo;t take decisions in the interest of community. They bow down, submit and take disgraceful steps. With American pressure the way Parvez Musharraf submitted to America they are expecting the same to happen again. If Pakistan submits to American pressure and hands over everthing to America again then this would a big mistake. As this is a merciless America of Trump, first it was the America of Bush which needed Pakistan. Then Obama came and dealt Pakistan in his own way and did not consider Pakistan at all important in fact as burden. Trump considers Pakistan as an obstacle whereas Obama considered Pakistan as a burden which we should not bear any more. The strategy which Pakistan has adopted they consider Pakistan as obstacle. This is because Pakistan has given way to China and China is a big opponent of America. China and Russia together can bring down the power of America whose effects can be seen. At present the downfall of America has begun and can be felt and this downfall is under the leadership of china and Russia. America is under panic due to this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week America did one more thing in the matter related to Qod&rsquo;s. In the Qod&rsquo;s issue when Trump declared Jerusalem as the capital of Israel after<img style="float: right;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/Untitled_1.png" alt="" width="285" height="192" /> which protests started and in the UN general Assembly around 24 countries who take funds from America voted against. There were only few countries who voted in favor of America and rest all voted aginst them including Pakistan. America got very upset that how can those countries who take aids from us voted against us. They took some action now. Trump&rsquo;s UN representative is a very bad character lady, Nikki Haley who has illegitimate relationships also with Trump. Though she said that I don&rsquo;t have such relationships but American newspapers have exposed their scandals with pictures that they are bad character persons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This lady Nikki Haley invited all the ambassadors of all the countries who take aids from America. This is the same strategy which Israel has adopted. Israel has trapped the Arab leaders of states through indecent women and they came under the trap of women. The same tactic Trump is also using now that through indecent women he is trapping the ambassadors, rulers of Muslim states so that they can attest American steps or at least not vote against them. When any issue rises aginst America they should not vote.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">China and Russia have decided that they will object, oppose all policies of America at all possible levels which they were not doing before. Russia was not doing this before due to their internal difficulties and China was staying away as precaution. China before was a state with precautionary policies but now they have left all precautions and they are no more a conservative China instead become an aggressive China. Hence china and Russia have formally united to disgrace America everywhere. Recently America faced this disgrace twice. One was when they called a UN meeting related to the protests in Iran. In that meeting both Russia and China insulted America that this is an internal issue of a country and why you called this meeting. Now recently another international UN conference that took place there also they insulted America that you bring your useless policies to UNO and that time has ended and UNO cannot blindly do what America says. Now China and Russia will not remain silent and they will oppose America at every level. Now in this situation America is fighting the war for survival. It is fighting under dominance whereas in the past it used to fight as a superpower dominating others but now their battle is for survival. These two countries will chew America and hence American policies is with severity to either punish those states or trap them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This filthy lady invited the ambassadors of these countries for dinner and we know what is offered in such dinners. There are such Middle East countries whose diplomats are ready to sell everything for money and women. These countries are also warned that if you support China and Russia we will stop all aids to them. They have stopped the aids of Pakistan and Egypt because they are not completely listening to American dictations. Amongst these nations they want to punish Pakistan and for this they prepared tyrants in Afghanistan. Fist ISIS was made to overcome Syria and Iraq; now it is the turn of Pakistan and Iran as both Pakistan and Iran are victims of similar issues. At present it is in the interests of both Pakistan and Iran to make a joint strategy and confront America in Afghanistan itself and not allow American intentions to be fulfilled. America will make excuses and carry out drone attacks in Pakistan; then they will take forward the Drone attacks which might come up to Islamabad and other places. Then there are other operations also expected by America. To reply America the strategy of Pakistan has never been to show resistance but this is the need of the hour and only way for Pakistan is to show perseverance and resistance. The government might not do this but not for the people, nation this is the best opportunity to get salvation from America. This opportunity has been provided by America only and we will never get an opportunity like this. If at this stage the entire nation can rise against America and give reply to America for every small operations of theirs against us. The way America is under pressure from other states from here as well they will be beaten on face. This way this tyrant country gets punished for the cruelty they have done in the last century and humanity gets salvation.</p>', 'Y', 'N', '1517591420Feb_2nd_2018_-_American_Conspiract_-_Pic_2.jpeg', 'SHYHIQ1JBD8', '1517591420American_Conspiracy_in_Afghanistan_for_Pakistan_and_Iran.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-02-03 04:40:18', 'Y'),

The 13<sup>th</sup> of Jamadi ul Awwal is also the date of Martyrdom of Lady Fatema (s.a) and also 3rd Jamadi us Sani. We had intended to commemorate 20 days for<img style="float: left;" src="http://politicalmarkaz.com/uploaded/3_1.png" alt="" width="270" height="204" /> Lady Fatema (s.a) and then 20<sup>th</sup> Jamadi us Sani is the birth anniversary of Lady Fatema (s.a). In these months where belief is there the Maarifat of Lady Fatema (s.a) and also exposition as Role Model and the values of Lady Fatema (s.a) should also be there. The Ayyame Fatema are not the days of just expressing our emotions but in fact it is the opportunity to complete the desire, wish of Lady Zahra (s.a) which was not fulfilled. She left this world with a broken heart which did not fulfill her desire. That desire needs to be fulfilled and as it is mentioned in traditions the pleasure of Lady Fatema (s.a) is where the pleasure of Allah is there. This is our self-carved understanding that Lady Fatema (s.a) only had the desire that someone should mourn for her son. Since mourning, lamenting is easy we can easily fulfill it but it is not easy to fulfill the actual desire of Lady Fatema (s.a) and that is the divine system, the system of Wilayat, the desire for system of Imamat.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the desire and wish of Lady Fatema (s.a). Those whom she got displeased and expressed it; she did not desire them to lament on her, did not allow them to attend her funeral and did not allow them to even visit her grave. She even asked to keep her grave as secret. If she had this desire that people should mourn after her she would have made her grave clearly evident so that every mourner can come and cry on me. She said that I don&rsquo;t like these uninterested, careless, senseless persons should visit my grave and hence her last will she said do not make my grave. The grave which is associated now with her is not her grave. As per some traditions only the Imams (a.s) know where the grave of Lady Fatema (s.a) is.&nbsp; Her only wish, desire was the established System of Wilayat and Imamat. She was detested on this, she was displeased, upset on this; she protested for this and for this she gave her life as well. She made her protest, resistance eternal which she established till Qayamat. We cannot find such a unique protest anywhere. The followers of Lady Fatema (s.a) has this duty to do this Zikr in the Ayyame Fatema. We have chosen are very easy duty of just mourning as it does not cost. You can cry anywhere whether in America, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world it won&rsquo;t make any difference neither will it cost anything. We have selected the easiest responsibility whereas whatever Lady Fatema (s.a) desired Imam Hussain went for the fulfillment of same to Karbala. The Path of desire for Lady Fatema (s.a) is Karbala. The path which the mother made the son went for its completion and the entire Ummah was prepared for mourning. The people of Medina, mecca, Basra, Kufa all cried and Lady Zainab criticized their crying. She condemned them severely when they were crying, and this lady was not at all impressed with their crying. We have made ourselves convinced that the pleasure of Lady Fatema (s.a) only lies in mourning. There is no denial about mourning as there are two types of mourning; one is out of grief and second is mourning in protest. If our mourning is same as that of Ahlulbayt (a.s) it is fine but if the mourning is just to please Lady Fatema (s.a) considering it as a desire, not protesting the same way she did then this attempt would not be so effective since centuries have passed and abandonment of Wilayat is still the same way. These days of Fatamiya are demanding from us those desires which are not fulfilled yet and reviving those is her rights and those values which the Lady expressed.</p>', 'N', 'N', '1517632852f-cp1.png', '4_ddhLFLafE', '1517592825The_unfulfilled_desire_of_Lady_Fatema.pdf', 'N', NULL, '2018-02-03 04:40:59', 'Y'),

On 1<sup>st</sup> Feb Imam (r.a) returned from Paris and the revolution entered in its practical phase and on 11<sup>th</sup> Feb the Islamic revolution succeeded and got established. These days are also very important for all Muslims, believers and for all those who have faith on the divine system of Wilayat and Imamat. For secular persons these days have no importance, for Mutahhajireen they don&rsquo;t have any significance. Secular are those irreligious persons who have separated world from religion; and Mutahhajireen are those who have separated religion from world. The secular are sitting with the world separating it from religion whereas Mutahhajireen are sitting separately with religion without the world. Mutahhajireen are those who don&rsquo;t have system in their religion and is not present anywhere. In their religion only Wudhu, purification, Hajj Zakat is there and their religion ends there only. Their religion is such that they have enough time left after practicing religion. Mutahhajireen are narrow minded, narrow temperament, narrow vision and insensible persons who have done the interpretation of religion upside down. For them also Islamic Revolution has no importance. Both Mutahhajireen and Mujaddid (modernist) have nothing to do with this topic. For those believers who believe on everything which Allah has descended for them this Islamic revolution is an important topic. Similarly for the enemies this is the most important topic and is the only topic which pinches and are using all their ability to finish this. Today is 2018 and almost forty years are near to be completed for the Islamic revolution. There are multiple conspiracies that have been done almost daily and everything failed. At present all have united; the Arabs, Zionists, western world to defeat this revolution and everyone has pledged to finish this system.
